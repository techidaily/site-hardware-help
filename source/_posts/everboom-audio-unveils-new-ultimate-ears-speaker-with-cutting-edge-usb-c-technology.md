## Everboom Audio Unveils New Ultimate Ears Speaker with Cutting-Edge USB-C Technology

Ultimate Ears is refreshing its lineup with USB-C versions of the Wonderboom, Boom, and Megaboom speakers. Plus, we're getting a brand new Everboom speaker that's primed for outdoor listening.

 The all-new Everboom speaker boasts an omnidirectional "oval" design with 360-degree sound. It has an integrated carabiner that can attach to bags and other items, and it offers IP67 resistance for sand and water immersion (it also floats in water). Ultimate Ears promises a 20-hour battery life from the Everboom, and users can set the speaker in Outdoor Boost mode to optimize the sound quality for outdoor listening.

 Multiple Everboom speakers can be paired together for an enhanced audio experience, and Everboom supports NFC tap-to-pair for Android phones. Note that the Everboom is really just an ultra-portable version of the [Epicboom](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/instagrams-social-filters-unfollow-guide/) speaker that launched last year. The only notable difference, aside from the size, is that Everboom lacks an adaptive EQ setting.

 While I'm excited to see a new product in Ultimate Ears' lineup, most of my love is going toward the upgraded Wonderboom 4, Boom 4, and Megaboom 4 speakers. These fourth-gen speakers add USB-C charging—finally, Ultimate Ears is saying goodbye to Micro USB! I don't know why the transition away from Micro USB took so long (the third-generation UE speaker lineup launched in 2022 and should've used USB-C), but hey, a win's a win.

 There don't appear to be any other major improvements in the fourth-generation Wonderboom, Boom, or Megaboom speakers. Ultimate Ears says that the Boom 4 and Megaboom 4 offer an improved "deep bass" response, and the Wonderboom 4 has a new podcast mode. Neat.

 As a quick side note, the UE BOOM app now features a "Megaphone" mode that effectively turns your Bluetooth speaker into a wireless PA system. Speak into your smartphone, and the sound will come out of your Ultimate Ears speaker. This feature would've been really useful when I was in college. Alas, I now own a bulky PA.

 Ultimate Ears' [updated speaker lineup](https://us.ultimateears.com/collections/speakers) is available today. The Everboom rocks a $250 price tag, meaning that it's $50 cheaper than the recently-released [Epicboom](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/instagrams-social-filters-unfollow-guide/). Pricing for the Wonderboom 4, Boom 4, and Megaboom 4 speakers is identical to that of their third-generation counterparts—these upgraded speakers are $100, $150, and $200, respectively.
