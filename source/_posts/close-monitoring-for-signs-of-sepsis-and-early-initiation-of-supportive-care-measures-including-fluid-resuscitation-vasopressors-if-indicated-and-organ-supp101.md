### Method 1: Download and update the drivers for your HP Elitebook 8460p manually

 You can download the updated driver files from the official website of HP. Then install them on your laptop on your own. Here is how to do it:

 This method is time-consuming and a little bit risk-taking, because you need to download the driver files that are compatible with your exact device model and your version of Windows. You also need to install them one by one on your own after you downloaded all the driver files. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills, it is highly recommended that you try **[Method 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. Click[**here**](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/home.html) to visit the official website of HP.
