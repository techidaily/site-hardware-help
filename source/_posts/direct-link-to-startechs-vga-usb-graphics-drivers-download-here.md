## What is VGA driver?

 VGA (Video Graphics Array) driver is the bridge between a device and the operating system. It is important for your computer to work properly. If you install the Windows system in a computer with an unsupported video adapter, the Windows will automatically select and install standard VGA drivers. But you’d better contact the original equipment manufacturer to get the compatible VGA driver.
