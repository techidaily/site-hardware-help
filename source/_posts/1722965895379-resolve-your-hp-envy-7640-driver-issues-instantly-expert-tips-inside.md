##  Way 1: Manually Update the Driver

 You can download and install the driver from the manufacturer ([hp.com](http://www8.hp.com) ). Download the correct driver corresponding with the printer model and the operating system your computer is running (see **[How to Get Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ). To install the driver, double click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions.

 HP always releases new drivers in order to keep the printer work effectively. So it’s recommended you often check for the new drivers.
