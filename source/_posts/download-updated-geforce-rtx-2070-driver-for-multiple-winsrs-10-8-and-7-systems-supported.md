If your M-Audio fast track isn’t recognized by your PC, it may indicate you need to update the M-Audio USB driver. **There are two ways you can update the driver: manually or automatically.**

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update the driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

## Option 2 – Download and install the driver manually

 M-Audio updates and releases the fast track USB driver on their website.To get the correct fast track driver, you need to go to the[M-Audio website](http://m-audio.com/support/drivers) **,** find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 The downloaded driver file could be a**zip** file or an**exe** file. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, verify the file format. If the file is in exe format, just double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. If the file is in zip format, you need to upzip the file first, then double-click the setup file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 Hopefully you can update the M-Audio fast track driver successfully by following the tips here. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave your comments. I’d love to hear of any ideas or questions.
