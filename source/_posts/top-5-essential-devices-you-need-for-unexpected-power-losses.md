 When the lights go out at home, checking to see if you flipped a breaker is always a good idea. But during a full power outage, things can turn from a minor disruption into a complete emergency. Here are some of the best gadgets to buy before your next power outage, whether it's a rolling blackout or something worse from summer storms.

 Power outages typically don't last all that long, but depending on where you live, you could experience days-long stretches without power. That's why you should be prepared with all the essentials or firewood during the cold winter months. These days, there are countless excellent gadgets, both big and small, that can keep the fridge running and help you stay safe.

##  Solar Lanterns and Rechargeable Lighting

![Rechargeable flashlight on a table connected to a battery.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/b90d1f1f.jpg) 

_[Yuriy Golub/Shutterstock.com](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/torch-light-charging-via-power-bank-1234275136)_

 While most people already [own a flashlight or two](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-8-engaging-exercise-routines-for-active-viewership/), having a rechargeable flashlight that's located in a designated spot is crucial. For example, I have a USB-C rechargeable flashlight that's always on top of the refrigerator, so I'll always have quick access to a light source.

 Another excellent option is a [solar LED lantern](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-motorola-moto-g34-5g-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). These can typically charge quickly from sitting outside in the sun, and many models can charge over USB, too. You can use nature or a power bank to top it off and continuously have light. Sure, lanterns come in all shapes and sizes, but getting something small or collapsible ensures it's not taking up a ton of space until it's genuinely needed.

 Goal Zero [makes a good one](http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Zero-Crush-Powered-Lantern/dp/B07BMJPH8L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), but I also own about five [MPOWERD Luci solar inflatable lanterns](https://www.amazon.com/MPOWERD-Luci-Outdoor-2-0-Rechargeable/dp/B0BX2GN4KL?ref%5F=ast%5Fsto%5Fdp&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen). They're small, packable, and great for camping, emergencies, and everything in between.

#####  MPOWERD Luci Outdoor 2.0: Solar Inflatable Lantern

The Luci outdoor lantern from MPOWERD is one of my favorite gadgets for camping or emergencies. It's small, lasts for hours, and can recharge through the sun or USB-C. 

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/MPOWERD-Luci-Outdoor-2-0-Rechargeable/dp/B0BX2GN4KL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen)

##  Surge Protectors to Keep Electronics Safe

![A Belkin surge protector on a workbench with cables plugged into it](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/53036701303_951f23b6cd_o.jpg) 

Hannah Stryker / How-To Geek

 These days, most people have a power strip or two, which offers multiple AC wall plugs for gadgets, TVs, and chargers. However, there's a difference between a [power strip and a surge protector](https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-recover-deleted-photos-on-xiaomi-without-backup-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/). A power strip gives you more outlets, but a surge protector shields your valuable electronics from excess voltage or damage during power outages or surges.

 Additionally, most surge protectors last only a few years, so even if you have one, it's probably a good idea to get something new. While [the best surge protectors](https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-rankings-top-budget-friendly-photo-editors-online-for-2024/) won't help you after the power goes out, they'll ensure your electronics work properly when the lights and power return.

#####  Belkin 12-Outlet Surge Protector (3,940 Joules)

Perfect for desks and entertainment centers, this Belkin 12-outlet surge protector can handle 3,940 joules and has an 8-foot power cord. Thanks to its built-in phone line and coaxial connections, it can also protect phones and cable boxes.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-BE112230-08-12-Outlet-Power-Protector/dp/B000J2EN4S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) 

##  Portable Power Stations Are a Must-Have

![Anker Solix C800 Plus outside on pavers](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/anker-solix-c800-plus-outside-on-pavers.JPG) 

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 I think [everyone should own a portable power station](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-pros-guide-to-conquering-photovideo-importers-in-win11/). When the power goes out for an extended period, these little boxes can keep the lights on, a fridge running so food doesn't spoil, all your phones charged to stay in contact with family, and much more. It's an essential tech item.

 Large power stations, like my [Anker 767,](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-infinix-hot-40-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/) are powerful enough to run a heater and make coffee, on top of doing everything else mentioned above. More importantly, many models have built-in lighting or can [recharge with solar panels](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-game-streaming-tool-analysis-choose-obs-or-shadowplay/). The result is a product that's excellent for emergencies. If the power grid is down long enough, use a solar panel or two to charge it outside, then use it at night to keep electronics up and running.

 Here are a few of our [favorite power stations available in 2024](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/easy-tutorial-downloading-and-installing-latest-xp-pen-drivers/).

##  Power Failure Night Lights

 Most of us probably had night lights as kids, but they're [great for adults](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/elevate-your-gaming-experience-4-techniques-for-gameplay-snaps/), too. Better yet, you can get a night light that'll turn on once the house goes dark each night and has a built-in battery for when there's a power failure.

 A power failure night light will instantly turn on when there's a power outage, ensuring your home is safely illuminated to go downstairs, use the kitchen, or dig for a flashlight in the garage. These multi-purpose lights are great around the house in general, but they become crucial during storms, power outages, hurricanes, and other situations.

#####  GE Power Failure Night Light (4-in-1)

Always have light when you need it most, whether that's at night or during a power outage. These automatically come on when the power goes out, lighting walkways, and have a long 2+ hour battery life. 

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Foldable-Emergency-Flashlight-29679/dp/B07C31FWMC?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) 

##  Power Banks and Chargers

 Portable chargers are ideal for traveling or vacations, but they're also essential items to have at home. Here's [why I have multiple power banks](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/learn-czech-fast-top-rated-online-language-apps/) and think most people should own at least a few.

 When the power goes out, you'll want a way to stay entertained, and that means charging your phone, AirPods, tablets, or even a laptop. So, whether that's a [pocketable backup battery](https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-achieving-audiovisual-consistency-in-premiers/) or something bigger like an Anker 20,000 mAh charger, you can keep all your gadgets up and running. If the power is out for an extended period of time, these become a valuable tool to ensure your phone has the power to communicate with family or get situational updates.

#####  Anker PowerCore Slim 10,000 PD

With enough power to charge multiple gadgets with USB-C PD fast charging, Anker's PowerCore Slim 10,000 will keep your iPhone or Android topped off while on the go. 

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-10000mAh-Delivery-PowerCore/dp/B08LH26PFT/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) 

##  And a Few Other Gadgets

Amazon Basics

 The items above are just a few of the many potential gadgets we recommend, mainly because they serve multiple purposes and can be used daily or during an emergency. However, those aren't the only things you may want.

 Depending on where you live, the frequency of power outages, and your budget all play a role in the types of emergency gadgets or supplies you have on hand. It's also a good idea to have some sort of [hand-crank radio](https://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Radio%EF%BC%8C4000mAh-Solar-Portable-Flashlight-Lamp%EF%BC%8CCell/dp/B083TLZN7G/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), [headlamps](https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Universal-Lightweight-Emergency-Batteries/dp/B08WC2VYMS?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), spare batteries, AC [power inverters](https://www.amazon.com/BESTEK-Inverter-Converter-Charger-Listed/dp/B07JJSW48V?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) you can use in a vehicle, a [heated blanket](https://www.amazon.com/Washable-Extremely-Comfortable-Electric-Controller/dp/B097Q85J47?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), or even a little [battery-powered cooling fan](https://www.amazon.com/10000mAh-Battery-Operated-Portable-Stroller/dp/B08C74XV6S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004030&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-to-buy-before-your-next-power-outage%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen).

 Then, remember to have some canned food, coolers, a first-aid kit, extra blankets, and a few board games or a deck of cards to keep yourself entertained. It's also advised to write down important phone numbers, just in case your phone dies and you run out of portable power.

 Experts suggest having enough supplies, power, and water to last upwards of 6 hours without power. But as we all know, it sometimes comes back in 20 minutes, or it's off for more than a day. Either way, it's better to be safe than sorry.
