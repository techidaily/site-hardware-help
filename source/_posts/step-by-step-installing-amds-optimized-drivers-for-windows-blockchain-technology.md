## Latest Konica Minolta Printing Drivers for Windows OS: Download Now

To make your Konica Minolta printer runs in a perfect condition all the time, it’s necessary to keep its driver up to date.

 If you’re not sure how to download and install the driver, follow this tutorial and you’ll learn 2 ways to get the latest Konica Minolta printer drivers, easily and quickly.

1. **[Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Automatically (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/konica-minolta-printer-drivers-download-and-install-guide/#option2)**

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Konica Minolta keeps updating drivers for its series of printers. You can go to its website, find the latest driver that corresponds with your operating system, and then download it. This process is a little time-consuming and error-prone, but we’ll show you how to do this step by step.

**1)** Go to **[Konica Minolta’s download center](https://www.konicaminolta.eu/eu-en/support/download-centre)**  .

**2)** Select your product model.

**4)** Select your operating system from the list.

**5)** Select the driver you want and click the**download icon** next to it.

 Once you finished downloading the right driver, double-click the downloaded file. Then, launch the setup file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

 If you’re not comfortable playing around with computers, you can install the printer driver automatically. And this is a lot faster and easier.

## Option 2 – Automatically install the Konica Minolta printer drivers (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Konica Minolta printer drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 All the drivers on Driver Easy come straight from the manufacturer, certified true and safe.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
