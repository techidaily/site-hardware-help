## Why do you need to update the Nvidia GeForce Game Ready driver?

 Driver functions as a translator between your device and operating system. The operating system gives a command to your device, but the device can not understand it. Both system and device donâ€™t actually speak the same language so they need a translator â€“ driver. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices but drivers havenâ€™t, devices canâ€™t receive correct commands and cause problems.

This is why most of the problems can be solved by updating drivers.

1. **[Manually download from the official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
