 There are multiple ways to [take screenshots on most Android devices](https://location-social.techidaily.com/3-things-you-must-know-about-fake-snapchat-location-on-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). One of the methods you may not know about doesn't even require pressing buttons. We'll show you how to do it just by tapping the back of your phone.

 Depending on your phone, you may have a built-in method for doing this. On Google Pixel phones, this feature is called "Quick Tap." Samsung Galaxy devices can use the RegiStar module in Good Lock. If your phone does not have this functionality built-in, we'll show you how to do it with a third-party app.

##  Google Pixel

 "Quick Tap" on Google Pixel phones can be found at Settings > System > Gestures > Quick Tap. First, swipe down twice from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon to open the Settings.

![Tap the gear icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot_20230824-163306-1.png) 

 Now scroll down and select "System."

![Select "System."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911-110042.png) 

 Go to the "Gestures" section.

![Go to "Gestures."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911-110045.png) 

 The one we want is "Quick Tap to Start Actions."

![Select "Quick Tap to Start Actions."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911-110048.png) 

 Toggle the switch on and choose "Take Screenshot" as the action.

 There's also an option to "Require Stronger Taps" if you find yourself taking screenshots accidentally.

 That's all there is to it! Simply tap the back of the phone twice to snap a screenshot.

##  Samsung Galaxy

 To use Back Tap gestures on a Samsung Galaxy device, we'll first need to install the "RegiStar" Good Lock module. Read[our full guide on how to use Good Lock](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-metaverse-mastery-rapidly-assemble-your-digital-self/) and install the RegiStar module.

![RegiStar module.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_111606_good-lock.jpg) 

 In RegiStar, select "Back-Tap Action."

![Select "Back-Tap Action."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_111616_registar.jpg) 

 First, turn it on at the top of the screen.

![Turn on "Back-Tap Action."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_111745_registar.jpg) 

 Now, you can select either "Double Tap" or "Triple Tap" gestures for the screenshot action.

![Select actions for the "Double Tap" and "Triple Tap" gestures](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_111718_registar.jpg) 

 Select "Take and Share Screenshot." Tap the gear icon to choose between "Basic" (normal screenshot) and "Share" (takes a screenshot and opens the share menu).

![Select "Take and Share Screenshot." Tap gear icon for more settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_162457_registar.jpg) 

 You also have the option to see a notification when Back-Tap is triggered, adjust the sensitivity of the gesture, and add "Gates," which are conditions in which Back-Tap will be paused.

![Set up "Gates" and sensitivity.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-09-11_13-51-53.jpg) 

 You're all set! Just tap the back of the phone the number of times you chose and a screenshot will be taken.

##  "Tap, Tap" App

 Open a web browser on your Android device and head to[the GitHub page for Tap, Tap](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/TapTap). Download the most recent APK file that's available and[sideload it on your Android device](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-premium-quality-streaming-on-the-worlds-largest-network/).

![Tap, Tap app from GitHub.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_112146_edge.jpg) 

 The first thing we need to do with Tap, Tap is toggle it on at the top of the screen.

![Toggle on Tap, Tap.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130424_tap-tap.jpg) 

 You'll also want to tap "Disable Battery Optimization" to make sure it's always running in the background.

![DIsable battery optimization.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130255_tap-tap.jpg) 

 Now, you can choose "Double Tap Actions" or "Triple Tap Actions" to take a screenshot.

![Select Double Tap or Triple Tap actions.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130424_tap-tapa.jpg) 

 Tap the "Add Action" button and select the "Screenshot" action.

![Tap "Add Action."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130403_tap-tapb.jpg) 

 Note that the screenshot action requires you to enable the Accessibility Service to run. You can do this by following the instructions in the notification.

![Enable the accessibility service.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230911_130551_settings.jpg) 

 Actions can also have "Requirements" added to them. This simply means certain conditions must be met in order for the action to trigger.

![Add a requirement to the action.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-09-11_14-53-43.jpg) 

 Lastly, there are "Gates." These are situations, similar to the Requirements, that will prevent the gestures from running. Requirements are for individual Actions, while Gates apply to all of them.
