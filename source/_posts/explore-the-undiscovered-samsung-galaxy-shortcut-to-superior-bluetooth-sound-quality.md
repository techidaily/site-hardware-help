##  What Does "Separate App Sound" Do?

 By default, all audio is played through the same output, whether it's your phone's speaker or a connected Bluetooth device. The Separate App Sound feature on Samsung Galaxy devices lets you choose which app you'd like to play media from when you're connected to a Bluetooth device.

 That simply means that you can decide to play music from the Spotify app on your Bluetooth speaker or headphones while audio from other apps, like watching a video on YouTube or taking a call, will go through your phone's speaker. The music playing on the Bluetooth device will not be interrupted by activities on other apps and vice versa.
