## 1. Apple Drops the Price on Latest Beats: A Budget-Friendly Alternative to AirPods

Ever since Beats was bought out by Apple in 2014, it has been an important part of Apple's efforts towards audio. Apple has its own lineup of earbuds and headphones, but it also keeps the Beats line as active as it has ever been, even pitching Beats earbuds as less "Apple-exclusive" products than its regular earbuds. Now, the company has just introduced new earbuds and headphones with the Beats Solo Buds and the Beats Solo 4â€”although there are a few reasons why we think the Beats Solo Buds might get more attention.

 Beats has introduced two new products: the Beats Solo Buds [true wireless earphones](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/locked-out-of-apple-iphone-xs-max-5-ways-to-get-into-a-locked-apple-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/) and the Beats Solo 4 headphones. The Beats Solo Buds offer big sound in a small package, boasting up to 18 hours of battery life and seamless pairing with both iOS and Android devices. The Beats Solo Buds feature custom-built acoustic architecture for enhanced audio performance and comfort. They include dual-layer transducers for high-fidelity sound and a custom-designed microphone for exceptional call quality. The earbuds offer up to 18 hours of playback and can be charged via USB-C.

Apple

 The most compelling feature on the Beats Solo Buds might be the price. They come in four colors and will be available for $79.99 starting in June 2024\. This makes them Apple's cheapest true wireless earbuds to date, as well as the second cheapest Beats product. The least expensive product currently sold by Beats is the the Beats Flex at $69.99, which doesn't earn the "true wireless" designation because the buds are connected with a cable.

 The Beats Solo 4 headphones feature upgraded sound, personalized spatial audio, and up to 50 hours of battery life. They come in three colors and are available for $199.99 starting immediately. The Beats Solo 4 headphones are designed for comfort and durability, with ultralight construction and plush cushions. They feature 40mm transducers for clear audio and personalized spatial audio for an immersive experience. The headphones offer up to 50 hours of battery life and support multiple connectivity options.
