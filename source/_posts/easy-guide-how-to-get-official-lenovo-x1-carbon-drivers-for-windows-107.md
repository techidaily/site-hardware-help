 3) When prompted, choose**Search automatically for drivers** .

 4) Windows will try finding the “latest” driver for your printer. But if it shows no available updates, you may need to try the next method below or choose to update the driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (the **[Pro Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  comes with a 30-day free trial).

### Option 2\. Download the driver from Canon official

 If the Windows Update doesn’t give you the latest version of the Canon MF743CDW driver, you can always find a new driver on the product information page.

 1) Go to the[product page of Canon MF743CDW](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/printers/color-laser/color-imageclass-mf743cdw) .

 2) In the top right corner, you can click the**PRODUCT INFORMATION** drop-down menu, and select**Drivers & Downloads** .

4) Once downloaded, run the driver file and complete the installation.

5) Restart your PC for the changes to take full effect.

### Option 3\. Download the driver automatically

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
