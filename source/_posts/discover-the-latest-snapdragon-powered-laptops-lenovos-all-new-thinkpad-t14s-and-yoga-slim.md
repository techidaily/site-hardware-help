## Discover the Latest Snapdragon-Powered Laptops: Lenovo's All-New ThinkPad T14s & Yoga Slim

Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon chips are supposed to be a more direct competitor to Intel and AMD. Lenovo has now announced two laptops with the new hardware: the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x and Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6.

 Lenovo has announced two laptops powered by the [Snapdragon X Elite chipset](https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-economical-sky-craftsmen-top-5-budget-friendly-drones/), which was revealed last year as an ARM-based System-on-a-Chip (SoC) for Windows PCs. It has a 12-core CPU, Qualcomm Adreno GPU, and a dedicated Qualcomm Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU) for machine learning and AI tasks.

 Qualcomm previously said the CPU can outperform an Intel Core i9-19380HX (one of Intel’s best laptop CPUs) and Apple’s M2 Max, but we’re still waiting on independent benchmark results. These will be among the first laptops to ship with Qualcomm’s chips.

##  Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x

 The first new laptop is the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x 14 Gen 9, which looks like a slightly-modified version of the [Slim 7 laptops](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fil%2Fen%2Fc%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-slim-series%2F) that Lenovo already sells with AMD and Intel processors. It weighs just 2.82 pounds (1.28 kg) and measures 0.5 inches (12.9mm) at its thinnest point.

 The Slim 7x has a 14.5-inch 3K (2944 x 1840) OLED touch screen, 70Whr battery, three 40Gbps USB Type-C ports (which can all handle power and external displays), a “FHD MIPI webcam” with a camera shutter, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3\. Those USB ports are the only physical connectivity—there’s not even a headphone jack.

 Besides the Snapdragon chip, you get up to 32GB RAM and up to a 1TB SSD. Lenovo didn’t mention in its announcement what the base configuration would use. The laptop will start at $1,199 when it arrives in June 2024.

##  Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen6

 Lenovo also revealed the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, which is more of a typical ThinkPad laptop with a blacked-out design and trackpoint in the center of the keyboard. It has the same Snapdragon X Elite chip as the Yoga Slim, but with a smaller 58Whr battery.

 The base model has a 14-inch 16:10 IPS screen without touch support, but higher end options include a touch IPS panel and a high-end 2.8K OLED screen. All models will also have a fingerprint reader on the power button. It supports up to 64GB RAM and up to 1TB storage, but again, we don’t know what the base model will include.

 The ThinkPad T14s is certainly better than the Yoga Slim in the ports department. You get two 5Gbps USB Type-A ports, two 40Gbps USB Type-C ports, an audio jack, and a dedicated HDMI 2.1 port. There’s also the same Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3 as the Yoga Slim, and Lenovo plans to sell a model later this year with integrated 5G.

 The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 will be available in June 2024, at a starting price of $1,699.
