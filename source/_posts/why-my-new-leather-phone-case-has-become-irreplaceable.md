 As a grizzled tech enthusiast, I was a "naked" phone purist until Samsung's S22 Ultra's wobble bump led me to leather cases. Surprisingly, they transformed, not just protected, my device. Here's why I've stuck with leather cases ever since.

##  Why I Was Caseless for Years

 Here's the thing. I love tech, and I've always been an advocate for the ["naked" phone](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/unleashing-the-full-potential-of-game-characters-with-voice-alteration-strategies-free/). The thought of wrapping my shiny, meticulously engineered device in some rubbery suit felt like sacrilege. I loved the cool touch of metal or glass, the minimalist lines of a sleek, modern designâ€”it just felt right. You spend so much on these flagship phones; it seemed a waste not to appreciate them in all their bare glory.

##  The Problem With Silicone and Plastic

 But then came the [Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra](https://www.reviewgeek.com/110490/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review-the-total-package/). You know, the one with the camera bump that's so big it practically needs its own zip code. Every time I laid it flat on a table, it felt like it was going to take a nosedive off the edge. So, for the first time in years, I found myself looking into [phone cases](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-ultimate-guide-to-calculate-your-youtube-views-and-money-for-2024/).

 Silicone ones were like lint magnets, pulling dust from every corner of my pocket. Plastic ones made my high-end phone feel like a cheap toy. I wasn't a fan. It felt like I was compromising the phone's intended design for the sake of function. What was the point?

##  Leather Elevates the Smartphone Experience

 Then, I thought about an option that had just never occurred to me: leather. Yes, it was the most expensive option, but honestly, it was not that much more than a quality case made from other materials. So, I ordered the Samsung leather case. And folks, it was a game changer. The leather felt premium, it looked classy, and it did a brilliant job of leveling out that pesky camera bump.

 I was so impressed that when I got the iPhone 14 Pro, I went straight for Apple's leather MagSafe cover. And you know what? Same deal. The leather case made the phone feel even more special, like it wasn't just something you bought through necessity but a genuine upgrade to these handsets.

##  What About Vegan Options?

 Now, I know what you're thinking: leather, really? Isn't that a bit... old-fashioned? Plus, there's the whole environmental and ethical side to consider. And you'd be right!

#####  Ethicase Vegan Leather Magnetic Case for iPhone 13 Pro 6.1 

Don't have a cow man. No, really.

[$35 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ethicase-Leather-Magnetic-Slim-Fit-Scratch/dp/B09NYKX1B7?tag=htg-v2-3cfdref-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201684&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F894152%2Fi-bought-a-leather-phone-case-and-im-never-going-back%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 The good news is that some solid vegan leather alternatives are out there. Brands are bringing out plant-based cases that look and feel surprisingly like the real deal. They're giving us an option that's better for the planet and still provides a touch of that luxury feel. You won't get exactly the same durability or wear behavior over time, but it's still a good sight better than other synthetic options, in my opinion. You can shop cases from Ethiscase, Moft, and other companies that are tapping into the desire for ethical vegan leather cases.

##  Apple Leaves Leather Behind

 One company we didn't mention in the last section is Apple. In 2023, Apple announced that it would no longer be making leather cases or [any leather accessories](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/). Instead, the company will now be using its "FineWoven" material to fill that premium niche. Unfortunately, initial reactions to FineWoven phone cases have been [mixed](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/) to say the least. So far we've yet to run into anyone that's in love with the new case material. It looks nice in the box, it looks nice for a few minutes outside of the box, and then the honeymoon period is quickly over as it rapidly gets scratched up and stained.

 So, putting aside the very lukewarm reaction to Apple's "FineWoven" vegan option, we can talk about other alternatives. Whether you feel these new synthetic options are a good alternative to real leather will be a matter of personal taste, but the good news is that for the time being there are still plenty of existing iPhone leather cases to buy for anything older than the iPhone 15, but it's very much a "while stocks last" situation.

The Casus vegan leather case offers a cool mix of leather and windows to show off the phone underneath. So you get the best of both worlds and as an added bonus, it's better for the animals.

[$15 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Casus-Compatible-Premium-Leather-Classic/dp/B09H6SDXNG/?tag=htg-v2-3cfdref-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201684&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F894152%2Fi-bought-a-leather-phone-case-and-im-never-going-back%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 While I think that the OEM Apple leather cases were excellent, Apple's decision won't stop third-party accessory makers from offering leather options, such as the [Wilken Leather Wrapped Case](https://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Wireless-Charging-Protection-Controls/dp/B09M7VK4QG/?tag=htg-v2-3cfdref-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201684&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F894152%2Fi-bought-a-leather-phone-case-and-im-never-going-back%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or the [Casus Vegan Leather cover](https://www.amazon.com/Casus-Compatible-Premium-Leather-Classic/dp/B09H6SDXNG/?tag=htg-v2-3cfdref-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU201684&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F894152%2Fi-bought-a-leather-phone-case-and-im-never-going-back%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). So, leather case lovers such as myself will still have a way to make Apple's phones truly premium for a while longer.

##  Final Thoughts

 My journey from a caseless phone user to a leather case enthusiast has been surprising to me. As someone who has always admired the raw beauty of a naked phone, these leather cases are not just a compromise; they're an upgrade. They've changed the way I interact with and appreciate my devices.

 So, if you're sitting on the fence about getting a case for your phone, why not give leather (or vegan leather) a shot? It just might change your perspective as it did mine. Once you've tried it, there's a good chance you, too, will never go back.
