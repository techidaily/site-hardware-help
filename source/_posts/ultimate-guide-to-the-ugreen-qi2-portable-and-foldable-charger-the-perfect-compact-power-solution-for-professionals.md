## Ultimate Guide to the Ugreen Qi2 Portable and Foldable Charger - The Perfect Compact Power Solution for Professionals

### Key Takeaways

* The Ugreen Foldable 2-in-1 Qi2 charger can charge a phone, earbuds, and has an extra USB-C port.

 Any small multi-device charger is tempting to use for travel, but I found the [Ugreen 2-in-1 Qi2 Foldable Charging Station](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Magnetic-Foldable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0CPF66RTD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003954&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-foldable-2-in-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) to be an ideal desk companion at home with its small footprint and extra USB-C port.

##  Perfect Size For a Desk

Close 

 When folded up, the Ugreen Foldable 2-in-1 is about as tall (and wide) as two AirPods cases stacked on top of each other. It’s not a very big product, but it is dense.

 I was surprised by its weight when taking it out of the packaging for the first time. It comes in at 212 grams or nearly half a pound. The weight is the device’s biggest deterrent for me to seriously consider a proper travel charger. Its thickness could be a problem for certain cable pouches too.

 Placing the charger on my desk, however, presented a real revelation of how inconspicuous it could be in a place often overly cluttered. It works perfectly as a minimal desk charger—a place I might need to regularly charge my AirPods and iPhone.

##  Feature-Packed For a Small Charger

Close 

 Arguably, the Ugreen Foldable 2-in-1 can only have so many features packed into its small frame, but it does make the most of its size.

 The top Qi2 magnetic charger can be used flat or vertically and can be raised or lowered to use the phone in portrait or landscape orientation. Turning a newer iPhone sideways while being charged unlocks [StandBy mode](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-different-ways-to-find-pokemon-go-trainer-codes-to-add-to-your-account-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) too to show widgets.

 The top part tilts up to 70 degrees, making it useful at all angles. It makes a decent stand for FaceTime calls or other video content because of its flexibility.

 I don’t need a dedicated AirPods charger most of the time, but in this instance, it doesn’t feel like the Ugreen Foldable 2-in-1 sacrifices anything to add it. It seems like a bonus, more than anything.

 The most clutch feature is an output USB-C port on the right side. It allows a temporary cable to be attached to provide a little bit of juice for a device that might not be wireless. In my case, I’ve used it to charge my [X100VI camera](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-premier-casts-for-google-listeners/).

 The main Qi2 wireless charger allows for 15W of power while the bottom one, meant for AirPods, can do 5W—a total of 20W wirelessly. The side USB-C port can handle 5W of power for 25W in total.

 I wish the side port allowed for more power, but based on the compact size of the device, it’s also understandable. It’s enough for random, occasional devices.

 If there is a case for this to be your portable charger, it would be plugging an Apple Watch charger into the side port. I still think that it is a little cumbersome for taking out of the house and needing to bring along a power adapter and two cables, in addition to this 2-in-1, but I wouldn’t fault anyone for going that route.

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 Despite its appearance at initial glance, travel would not be my intended use for the [Ugreen 2-in-1 Qi2 Foldable Charging Station](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Magnetic-Foldable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0CPF66RTD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003954&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-foldable-2-in-1-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority). Although it can certainly handle that task. I used it primarily as a desk charger and loved its minimal footprint and wide functionality. I think it works best in this kind of role on a surface in a home where people don’t have much room. It’s like a mini-hub thanks to its side USB-C port that can add a third device to the charging party.

 The $60 retail price isn't outrageous for this type of device, among its peers, but it's not cheap. In that context, my biggest wish is that this premium-priced charger didn't have "UGREEN" plastered right across the front of it.
