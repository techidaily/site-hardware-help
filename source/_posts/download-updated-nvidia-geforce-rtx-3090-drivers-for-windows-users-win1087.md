 Are you looking for the latest**drivers** for your**Targus Displaylink** devices? If so, then you’ve come into the right place. This post will show you how to download and update your Targus DisplayLink drivers step by step.

## What are Targus DisplayLink drivers?

 To answer this question, we must explain each of the three words separately.**Targus** is a manufacturer of computer-related products from laptop bags to universal docking stations while**DisplayLink** is a chip and software company whose technology is used in many products. And a**driver** , to put it simply, is an invisible bridge that connects hardware and software. Without drivers, most of your hardware devices cannot run properly.

 Honestly speaking, there’s no such thing as “Targus DisplayLink driver”, but there are certain drivers designed for a Targus device (such as a docking station) that adopts the DisplayLink technology. For example, Targus Dock 190 is one of the featured products using the DisplayLink technology.

## How can I update my Targus DisplayLink drivers?

 If you’re using a Targus device which adopts the DisplayLink technology, please keep in mind that updating your drivers in time can ensure the stability of your device and prevent lots of problems from happening. Generally there’re two ways you can update your drivers:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended):](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-update-targus-displaylink-drivers-in-windows-10-8-7/#option1)**  This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even you’re a computer newbie.

OR

[**Option 2 – Manually:**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
