## Unleash Productivity with New Microsoft Copilot-Powered PCs, Featuring Top Snapdragon Elite X Options Today

Several PC manufacturers recently[launched Qualcomm-powered laptops](https://tools.techidaily.com) and many models are hitting store shelves and shipping out from today. These[Copilot+ PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) come with Arm-based[Snapdragon X chips](https://tools.techidaily.com) featuring a 45 TOPS NPU and have new AI-powered features,[like Paint’s Cocreator](https://tools.techidaily.com) , as well as access to the controversial Windows Recall feature that’s been relegated[to Windows Insiders](https://tools.techidaily.com) only.

 Although these new Copilot+ PCs are only getting a few new features to start with, other third-party apps like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, DaVinci Resolve Studio, CapCut, and more will use the built-in NPUs on these computers to run AI features locally. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Arm-based processors of these chips means we’re finally getting Windows laptops that can compete with the legendary battery life of Apple-silicon-powered MacBooks.

 So, if you’re in the market for a new Windows laptop and want to get in on the AI bandwagon, these are the Snapdragon X laptops launching today or in the next few weeks.

## Acer Swift 14 AI

 The Swift 14 AI is Acer’s bet on the Copilot+ PC, and it can be had with either a Snapdragon X Plus or Snapdragon X Elite chip. It also has a 75Wh battery, which the company claims will give the laptop up to 26 hours of battery life. You can also spec it with as much as 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.

Interestingly, the 15-inch model (which can only be had with a Snapdragon X Elite chip) starts at $1,299.99, but this one only has a 256GB SSD, which seems awfully small for today’s requirements. If you want to get this Copilot+ PC, the Surface Laptop is now available on[the Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-laptop-7th-edition/8tq2hq5xxkj9) .

 These laptops are the first tranche of the Copilot+ PCs that Microsoft and Qualcomm launched into the wild.
