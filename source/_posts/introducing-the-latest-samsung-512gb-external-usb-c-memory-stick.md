## Introducing the Latest Samsung 512GB External USB-C Memory Stick

Samsung has released a 512GB version of its USB-C flash drive, priced at $80\. The sleek metal drive incorporates a USB 3.2 Gen 1 interface capable of reading and writing data up to 400MB/s and 110MB/s, letting you transfer big files between computers, back up data, or even boot a PC.

 The company announced this model alongside 512GB versions of its USB-A flash drives [back in April](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-video-editing-simplified-the-best-hacks-for-new-creators/), but it took until early-August to go on sale. Joining the existing 64GGB, 128GB, and 256GB models priced at $14, $21, and $35, respectively, the 512GB version is compact enough to fit any pocket or wallet. It measures just 2.28 x 0.72 x 0.29 inches and weighs 0.27 pounds (122 grams).

 Unlike the smaller [Samsung Fit Plus drive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYMB3HG4/?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsamsung-flash-drives-512gb-capacity%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsamsung-512gb-usb-c-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), this model won't block other ports on some machines. All models in the series are "tough enough to take on everything with protection from elements like water to extreme temperatures." You can submerge the drive in seawater 1m deep for up to 72 hours, and it can withstand extreme temperatures. Samsung backs it with a 5-year limited warranty, which includes magnet, X-ray, and shock protection as well. Of course, that doesn't mean you should throw this drive into a fire pit or take it with you on diving trips, but at least you have peace of mind knowing your files should be fine in most circumstances.

 You can freely use the drive with any device with a USB-C port, including mobile devices like Android phones and the iPhone 15 series. Older computers can connect to the driver via a USB-C to USB-A adapter at the expense of performance. There are many [reasons why you'd want an external drive](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-kodi-streaming-service-windows-media-replacement/), and this model offers additional uses beyond file storage. For example, if your digital camera or DSLR is equipped with USB-C, plugging the drive lets you capture video recordings and photographs directly onto it. Samsung claims the drive can transfer 4GB of 4K videos in just nine seconds. Apple fans will appreciate that it supports direct ProRes 4K video capture at 30fps on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max.

 Samsung's flash drives are highly rated as the company has been building flash memory products since 2003, but that doesn't mean there aren't more affordable options available. For example, [SanDisk's Ultra Dual Drive Go](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsandisk-ultra-dual-drive-go-256gb-usb-type-a-usb-type-c-flash-drive-black%2F6421486.p%3FskuId%3D6421486) offers similar features and performance but provides a secondary USB-A connector and is priced half as much as the Samsung. The Kingston DataTraveler Max, another noteworthy alternative, beats Samsung in data speed while undercutting its price.

 Flash drives can work as [bootable drives for installing Windows](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-excellent-devices-for-frame-by-frame-filmmaking/) or other operating systems. If you're planning on using this Samsung as your everyday boot drive, it's wiser to consider a [full-size external SSD](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-engage-fans-through-real-time-streams-mobile-edition/) like the [Samsung T7](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-SSD-1TB-MU-PC1T0T/dp/B0874XN4D8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004721&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsamsung-flash-drives-512gb-capacity%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fsamsung-512gb-usb-c-flash-drive%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) that offers much higher speeds. You could also get an [NVMe drive in a dedicated USB enclosure](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-oppo-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/). Personally, I've been very pleased with [NVMe SSD enclosures from Dockcase](https://www.dockcase.com/category/ssd-enclosure) but feel free to explore your options.

 You can [buy the 512GB Samsung USB-C flash drive](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmemory-storage%2Fusb-flash-drives%2Fusb-type-c-flash-drive-512gb-blue-muf-512da-am%2F) from the company's online store. It should appear at Amazon and other retailers soon.
