## How to update the Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Dock driver

To update the Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Dock driver, you have two options:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-lenovo-thunderbolt-3-dock-drivers/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR
