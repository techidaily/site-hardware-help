## To update Surface Book Drivers

**[Option 1 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/surface-book-drivers-download-update-easily/#O1)**  â€“  This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

**Driver Easy**   will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy.
