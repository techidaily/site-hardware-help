##  What to Look for in a Bluetooth Adapter in 2024

 Bluetooth adapters come in various shapes and sizes and serve different purposes. Whether you need one for your TV, PC, [Bluetooth keyboard](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-bypass-frp-tools-for-pc-that-actually-work-by-drfone-android/), car, or [Nintendo Switch](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-your-whatsapp-location-is-not-updating-and-how-to-fix-on-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), knowing the specific use will help you choose the right size and type, though they're all pretty portable.

 The Bluetooth version is important, too. Our recommended adapters range from Bluetooth 4.0 to 5.3\. While a Bluetooth 5.3 adapter can work with older versions like Bluetooth 4.0 and lower, it will be limited to the features of the lower version.

 Make sure to also check OS compatibility, since not all adapters work with every operating system or device. For example, the TP-Link UB500 works with Windows 7, 8.1, 10, and 11, but not Windows 8.

 Consider the size of your space and choose an adapter that offers sufficient coverage. The adapters we recommend cover between 30 feet and 65 feet.

 Finally, think about how many devices you'll be connecting at once. Our featured adapters can connect between two and seven devices simultaneously, but adding more devices can impact performance.

 If you're looking for the best Bluetooth adapter for most people, we recommend the [TP-Link UB500 Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's compact, portable, and very affordable. Plus, it's powered by Bluetooth 5.3 technology, ensuring fast and reliable connections and impressive data transmission rates.

 Using the TP-Link UB500 is super easy. Just plug it into a USB port on your computer, and you're all set. It works seamlessly with Windows 8.1, 10, and 11\. If you have Windows 7, you'll need to download the relevant driver from the [TP-Link website](https://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/ub500). Downloading is free, and the process is straightforward.

 This adapter isn't just for your computer—it also supports PS5/PS4 and [Xbox controllers](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-simple-tale-creation-guide/) when connected to a PC. While it doesn't work with Windows 8, XP, Mac, Linux, or TVs, it's perfect for connecting Bluetooth devices like printers, phones, keyboards, mice, and headsets. In fact, you can connect up to seven devices at a time.

 With a range of up to 65 feet, you can stay connected even if you're moving around your home or space, as long as there aren't any major obstacles in the way. This makes it great for households or offices where multiple people need to connect to Bluetooth devices simultaneously.

 The TP-Link UB500 Bluetooth Adapter is a steal at less than $13\. However, if you want to save more and don’t mind Bluetooth 4.0, we recommend the [TP-Link UB400 Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It costs less than $10 and still delivers high-quality performance like the [TP-Link UB500](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Thanks to its plug-and-play design, installing and setting up the TP-Link UB400 is super easy—plug it into your PC, and you're ready to go. It supports Windows 8, 8.1, 10, and 11\. If you're using Windows 7 or XP, you'll need to download the [free driver](https://www.tp-link.com/en/download/UB400.html) from the TP-Link website.

 Another thing we like about the TP-Link UB400 is its impressive range. Unlike Bluetooth 4.0 adapters that keep you tethered to your PC, the UB400 offers up to 65 feet of coverage, similar to the TP-Link UB500\. Just make sure to disable any built-in Bluetooth on your PC for the best experience.

 While the TP-Link UB400 is mainly designed for PCs, it also supports PS4 and Xbox controllers connected to a PC. Although it is incompatible with Mac, Linux, or TVs, it works with various Bluetooth devices like printers, phones, keyboards, mice, and headsets and can connect seven devices simultaneously.

 Looking to add Bluetooth to your non-Bluetooth car or home audio system? [The COMSOON Aux Bluetooth Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B08KY684PB/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004640&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-adapters%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a solid choice that we highly recommend. This handy little device lets you stream music, podcasts, or any other audio wirelessly through your aux port (3.5mm audio jack).

Perfect for non-Bluetooth car audio systems, it also works great with home stereos, speakers, and wired headphones. Setup is a breeze: power it up, plug it in, pair your device, and start playing your favorite tunes.

 Another thing we like about the COMSOON Aux Bluetooth Adapter is its support for hands-free calling. Advanced noise cancelation will make your calls crystal clear and free from background noises like wind, traffic, or crowds. It also broadcasts navigation notifications so you can keep your eyes on the road and not on your screen.

 You can connect up to two devices at once, and the adapter provides up to 16 hours of continuous use on a full charge, which takes about 2.5 hours with the included type-C cable. This portable Bluetooth adapter allows you to easily upgrade your non-Bluetooth car or headphones into a wireless powerhouse.

## FAQ

### What is Bluetooth?

 Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows connected devices to communicate with each other over short distances. Modern devices like smartphones, headphones, speakers, keyboards, mice, and even cars, all use Bluetooth technology.

### Should I get a 4.0 or 5.0 Bluetooth adapter?

 Choosing between a Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 adapter really comes down to your needs. Bluetooth 5.0 is more advanced and offers better performance, but both versions are backward compatible with older devices. If you use a Bluetooth 5.0 adapter with a Bluetooth 4.0 device, it will operate at the lower version’s capabilities. If you’re planning to upgrade your tech soon, it might be a good idea to go for the 5.0 adapter. It’ll work with your current devices and be ready for any new tech you get in the future.

### What is the difference between a Bluetooth adapter and a Bluetooth receiver?

 A Bluetooth adapter adds Bluetooth functionality to non-Bluetooth devices, allowing them to both send (transmit) and receive audio signals wirelessly, whereas a Bluetooth receiver is designed to only receive and play auido signals wirelessly. 

### Will a Bluetooth adapter reduce sound quality?

 The impact of a Bluetooth adapter on sound quality depends on the codecs it uses and its data transfer rates. Adapters with Bluetooth 5.0 or 5.3 technology generally offer better sound, connectivity, range, and lower latency than those with Bluetooth 4.0\. So, while a lower version adapter might affect sound quality, a higher version one can actually enhance it.
