 As the translator for your device and operating system, a device driver plays a significant role in making a device work properly. Your Insignia USB to VGA adapters, too, needs a specific driver to establish a connection.

 Normally, when you plug the adapter into your computer, the Windows system will automatically install the driver accordingly. However, sometimes the operating system fails to do so, and youâ€™ll need to do it by yourself.

## How to update a driver

 The normal process of updating a driver manually is downloading the driver file from the manufacturerâ€™s website, and then you can unzip the file and install the driver by yourself.

 However, you can use a trusted driver updater to help you install all the latest drivers automatically. This is the easiest way to update a driver. So weâ€™ll include these two main methods below:

[**Option 1 â€“ Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/insignia-usb-to-vga-adapter-driver-download-install/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks â€“ easy even if youâ€™re a computer newbie.
