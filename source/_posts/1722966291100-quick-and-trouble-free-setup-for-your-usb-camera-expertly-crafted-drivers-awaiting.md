## How to update your USB camera driver

There are two ways you can update your USB camera drivers :

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  

 OR  

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-usb-camera-driver-quickly-easily/#option2) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

 Manufacturers of USB cameras such as Logitech keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to visit their official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 Or if you would like to update your drivers via**Device Manager** , you may refer to **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for more detailed information.
