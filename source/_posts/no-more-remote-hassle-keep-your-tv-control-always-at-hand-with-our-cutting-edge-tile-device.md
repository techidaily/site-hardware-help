## No More Remote Hassle - Keep Your TV Control Always at Hand with Our Cutting-Edge Tile Device!

Can't they make a [Bluetooth tracker](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fixing-microsoft-edge-crashes-in-windows-11-effective-solutions-discovered/) for everything? Tile gets really close.

 I can't begin to tell you how often I've lost my remote control. It's not something that is counted in how many times I lose it in a month or week—it's the number of times I lose it in a _day_. I can't think of a day in recent memory where I didn't spend at least a few minutes wandering around my apartment, trying to figure out where I thought was a good place to put the remote this time.

 It's frustrating! I used to constantly have this problem with my keys, wallet, and phone. Eventually, I picked up a Tile Starter Pack to help keep track of those essentials, and using a Bluetooth tracker felt life-changing—not only would my keys make a loud noise that could be heard from whatever crevice they fell into this time, but I could use the Tiles to ping my phone to sound a loud alarm so I could find it.

 But this doesn't solve the problem of losing my remote control. After all, you can't exactly attach a [Tile Slim](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2NYJ3T?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) or [Tile Mate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2XXBFR?tag=htgprimedaysite-20&th=1) to it. But it turns out there was a solution all along—the [Tile Sticker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B3XCXHN?tag=htgprimedaysite-20).

 The Tile Sticker does what it says on the tin. You stick them onto whatever you're prone to losing a lot, and you can track it the same way as you would all your other Bluetooth trackers. The fact that it's small is the real selling point here, so sticking a Tile Sticker to most things you're prone to lose is a good idea.

 Of course, Tile is participating in [Prime Day sales](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-still-using-pattern-locks-with-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/), so you can pick up a two-pack of these helpful little Bluetooth trackers for just $37.99\. While getting them on sale is great, nothing beats the peace of mind of knowing you can find your stuff again.
