### Key Takeaways

* Battery health is an important factor in the long-term usability of your phone, as it indicates how much the battery is deteriorating.
* Samsung Galaxy phones have a built-in method for checking battery health through the Samsung Members app.
* If you don't have a Samsung Galaxy device, you can try accessing Android's hidden diagnostic menu using dialer codes, or use a third-party app like "DevCheck" from the Play Store.

 Battery life is something most people think about, but what about battery _health_? This is important for the long-term usability of your phone. [Unlike the iPhone](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/the-verdict-on-vllo-performance-for-2024/), Android devices don't have a super-easy way to check this.

 What is battery health, anyway? The term "battery life" typically refers to how long the battery will last on a charge. Battery _health_ tells us how much the battery is deteriorating. Low battery health means the battery will perform worse—discharge faster, get warm, etc.

##  Check Battery Health With the Hidden Diagnostic Menu

 Samsung Galaxy devices have a built-in method for checking battery health through the settings, but that's not possible on most other Android devices. There's one method you can try that doesn't require third-party apps, but it might not work for your specific phone.

 This method uses [Android's hidden diagnostic menu](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-by-drfone-android/) that can be accessed by entering codes in the phone dialer. However, these codes do not work on all devices and mobile networks.

 Open the phone app and enter **\*#\*#4636#\*#\***. This will open a "Testing" menu that may include a "Battery information" section. You'll see the battery health listed here.

 If that didn't work—there's a good chance it won't—you'll need to use a third-party app.

##  Check Battery Health With a Third-Party App

 If the diagnostic menu trick doesn't work, there are plenty of third-party apps in the Play Store that you can use to check battery health. One that we like is called "[DevCheck](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU207573/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flar2.devcheck)."

 After installing the app, open it and navigate to the "Battery" tab at the top of the screen.

##  How to Preserve Battery Health on Android

 Battery health is almost entirely tied to the number of charging cycles the battery has gone through. Simply put, charging your phone a lot is actually not good for the battery. Heat is also a bad thing for batteries, which can happen from overcharging—[or just being left out in the sun](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/navigating-through-the-effects-of-quick-access-memory-and-delay-time-on-your-computers-operation/).

 This may sound counterintuitive to the "don't charge your phone a lot" advice, but one of the best things you can do for battery health is not to let it get down to 0% often. The battery in your smartphone is best kept between 20-80%. [iPhones can do this while charging overnight](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-your-workflow-with-mac-preview-complete-guide/), and some Android phones have the same thing.

 Resisting the urge to overcharge your phone will go a long way, but we've got a [full guide with more tips for preserving battery health as well.](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-infinix-gt-10-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/)

 Battery health is generally not something you need to check frequently, but it can play a role in the longevity of your device if you [plan on using it for several years](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfecting-sound-with-advanced-audacity-methods/) (which is a good thing to do).
