## How to update your USB camera driver

There are two ways you can update your USB camera drivers :

## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

 Manufacturers of USB cameras such as Logitech keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to visit their official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 Or if you would like to update your drivers via**Device Manager** , you may refer to **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for more detailed information.
