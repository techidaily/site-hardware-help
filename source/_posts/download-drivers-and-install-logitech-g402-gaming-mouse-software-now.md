## Logitech K400+ Wireless Keyboard Software and Drivers: Install Now

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-23_11-07-44-1.jpg)

 The Logitech K400 Plus driver runs on your computer, and enables it to communicate with the wireless keyboard you use. Your device wonâ€™t fully function if the driver hasnâ€™t been properly installed on your computer.

 So, if youâ€™re using a Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 Plus and itâ€™s not working properly now, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

 There are two ways you can get the latest correct Logitech K400 Plus driver:

* **[Option 1 â€“ Automatically update the Logitech K400 driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-logitech-k400-plus-driver-issues/#a)**
* **[Option 2 â€“ Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Option 1 â€“ Automatically update the Logitech K400 Plus driver

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
