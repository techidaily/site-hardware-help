##  The Neo Is New, But the Idea Is Old

 The Stream Deck is far from a new idea. Elgato has been tinkering with this concept of a desktop control center for years and has put out a lot of variations of it to try and meet different types of people's needs—from advanced streamers to beginner tinkers. What the Neo does specifically is address the entry-level of this market.

 Personally, that’s what I what I've wanted from a desktop controller. I wouldn’t particularly want to pay more than $100 for my simple button-pressing needs and Elgato is delivering something simple for a reasonable price.

 Speaking of simple, there’s nothing in the box except for the Neo with its connected USB-C cable. You can tilt it however you like, but there are two pre-configured angles that a stand slots into so that the unit doesn’t fold down when it's pressed. Although the unit is pretty basic, clad in plastic, it still looks and feels nice.

 If there’s anything I’m not crazy about, it’s the two touch-sensitive areas to the left and right of the information bar. They look nice and allow people to swipe through pages without using any buttons for that task, but there have been moments when they were less than responsive. You need to touch them just right. I never had any problems activating the customizable LCD keys. Those are tactile and satisfying to use.

##  Elgato’s Stream Deck Software Could Use Some Work

![close up of Elgato Stream Deck Neo buttons](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/elgato-stream-deck-neo-1.jpg)

 The hardware side might be worth getting excited about, but the software side of Stream Decks leaves something to be desired. It’s not that the Elgato Mac app I used was bad, but it could use some streamlining, especially for new users.

 The software can be powerful, allowing people to link apps and different actions together in a single button press, but getting to that point takes some imagination or research. Just like anything dealing with automation. Out of the box, downloading the Stream Deck software, you can do things like open applications, pause and play media, and open a website. If all you want to do is off-load these buttons from your keyboard to a more visible controller, then the Neo is perfect for that.

 To get the full experience you'll need to venture into Elgato Marketplace where there are free and paid controls available. You shouldn't have to venture too far to find things like Apple Music and Spotify controls which will display artwork on the LCD while songs are playing.

 Going farther into the marketplace will lead to more specialized shortcuts and controls for Photoshop, Davinci Resolve, OBS, Logic Pro, and many others. For more casual users who might be tempted by the Neo, there are free profiles for things like Chrome, Zoom, and emojis.

 Of course, if you do want to spend time with Neo and put in the work to change all the icons and text, it can still do everything other Stream Decks can do. I didn't feel that need beyond testing the functionality. The point is that Neo might be geared toward first-time tinkers, but it's not really limited in how much depth someone could get out of it.

##  Should You Buy the Elgato Stream Deck Neo?

 The [Elgato Stream Deck Neo](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-neo) is only one of many controllers the company makes. If it’s too simplified for your needs then there are plenty of other choices, including one with [knobs](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-screen-recorders-journey-a-deep-dive-into-the-best-tools/). What the Neo does well is create a very good on-ramp for casual users who might be overwhelmed with other Stream Decks.

 From its look and features to its $99 price, I think the Stream Deck Neo is a great option for anyone looking to have a bit more control over their desktop or laptop without going overboard.
