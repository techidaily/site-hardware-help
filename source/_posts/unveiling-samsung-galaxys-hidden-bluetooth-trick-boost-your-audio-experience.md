##  What Does "Separate App Sound" Do?

 By default, all audio is played through the same output, whether it's your phone's speaker or a connected Bluetooth device. The Separate App Sound feature on Samsung Galaxy devices lets you choose which app you'd like to play media from when you're connected to a Bluetooth device.

 That simply means that you can decide to play music from the Spotify app on your Bluetooth speaker or headphones while audio from other apps, like watching a video on YouTube or taking a call, will go through your phone's speaker. The music playing on the Bluetooth device will not be interrupted by activities on other apps and vice versa.

##  How To Turn On Separate App Sound

 The Separate App Sound feature is found in the "Sounds and Vibration" settings. First, swipe down once from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon to open Settings, then go to "Sounds and Vibration."
