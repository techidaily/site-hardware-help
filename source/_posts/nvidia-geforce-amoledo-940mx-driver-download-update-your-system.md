 Are you looking for the**Intel NVMe drivers** ? If the answer is “yes,” then you’ve come to the right place.

Don’t worry, here we’ll show you how to update your Intel NVMe drivers.

## How to update your Intel NVMe driver

There are two ways you can update your driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  

 OR

## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

**Intel** keeps updating the NVMe drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Intel Support](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/35125/Memory-and-Storage)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the driver manually.
