## Charge in Peace: Protect and Lock Down Your Devices' Chargers From Unwanted Thieves Using an Ingenious Cable Safeguard Solution

Are you tired of missing charging cables and feel like they always walk away from walls and end up lost? We all have that one family member who constantly steals our iPhone or Android charging cables, which inevitably disappear. I bought a PermaPlug phone charger wall lock, and you should, too.

 Lightning and USB-C charging cables can get expensive, especially when you put one in every room, have a houseful of children taking them to school, or let friends borrow them. Plus, somehow, the one in your car always ends up lost.

 The charging brick itself is expensive, and those always disappear, too. My wife loses her charger as often as her car keys, and I found a solution that is saving me money and my sanity. I'm talking about the PermaPlug dual-port phone charger lock, which conveniently is on sale for [only $34 during Amazon Prime Day](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CG2KMR3H?tag=htgprimedaysite-20).

#####  Permaplug Charger Lock

Never lose your charging cables or wall plugs again with the Permaplug charger lock. It's tug-proof, locks into place, and ensures your charger is always where you left it.

[Buy on Amazon](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CG2KMR3H?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) 

 This simple little gadget will ensure you never lose your charging brick or cables again. That all-important USB-C cable will _always_ be where you left it.

 With the PermaPlug, you replace the outlet faceplate with a custom-made cover that perfectly fits the included dual USB-A and USB-C fast charging wall plug, all while securing the cables in place. It's easy to install and only takes a matter of minutes. You've likely seen something similar in select hotel rooms, but now you can bring the same convenience and peace of mind to your home.

 Installation is a breeze, and both ports are certified as USB fast charging, so you know your iPhone, iPad, Galaxy, or Android device will recharge quickly. If there's one downside, you can only install it in one direction, and the cables will face up. While that's perfect for behind a couch or desk, it might look messy in the kitchen. And yes, it still leaves the second AC wall outlet open.

 As an added benefit, the tug-proof design prevents you from accidentally pulling the charger out of the wall when you roll over in bed to shut off the alarm. Additionally, if you already have a charging block and cable you want to secure, here's [another more affordable option](https://amazon.com/dp/B07W81LNTD?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). Either way, locking your charger in place will save you money and prevent you from buying yet another 4-pack of cables.
