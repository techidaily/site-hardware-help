 Founded in 2016, the company has rapidly climbed the league table of pioneering robotic home cleaning companies and proudly sits among the top five brands globally.

 With an emphasis on ‘scientific cleaning,’ Narwal’s research and development teams utilize innovative technology and designs to increase the power and strength of its devices.

 Designed to be sleek and quiet, Narwal also incorporates advanced tech to improve its home cleaners’ navigation and adaptability when they are going about their duties.

 This Prime Day, Narwal is offering some unbelievable discounts on its advanced robot vacuums and mops. With possible savings of [up to 57%](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/9AD3D0C5-88F5-463D-9B6F-95A79BB9E14D?ingress=3&maas=maas%5Fadg%5F80D600209587572D51A7D979DBC5C354%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas), now is the time to join the robotic revolution and lighten your own workload while still having flawless floors.

##  Narwal’s Tech Arsenal Redefines Robotic Home Cleaning

 Narwal’s robovacs and mops offer a range of advanced tech that revolutionizes the art of automatic vacuum cleaning. Each new innovation means less work for you.

 With the latest advancements and industry firsts, a Narwal robot vacuum ensures there is one less household task for you to do. Additionally, the devices require minimal attention and maintenance, allowing you to focus your precious energy elsewhere.

###  Certified Zero Tangling Floating Brush

 Pet owners will love the latest Narwal robotic vacuum mops that are equipped with the world’s first Zero-Tangling Floating Brush. Leveraging “Hairodynamic” technology that guides hair into its suction ducts, it is certified to capture 99.56% of hair with 0% tangles by renowned testing institutes SGS and TÜV Rheinland.

 That means no more cumbersome untangling and a fur-free home at minimal effort for you.

###  AI DirtSense™ Technology

 This innovative tech uses sensor arrays and algorithms to monitor dirt levels. The sensors monitor the color of wastewater and dust particles to determine the required level of cleaning. And make no mistake, Narwal robovacs, with this technology, won’t quit until your floors are spotless.

###  Dust Compression Technology

 With the ability to store dust and debris for up to seven weeks before needing to be emptied, Narwal has made sure its customers can keep their homes spic and span with little exertion and maintenance.

 This innovative compression system compacts dust within the robot, so it does not need to be emptied into the base station. This not only increases the vacuum’s capacity but also ensures that when it comes time to empty, the process is quick and clean with no dust clouds or mess to contend with. This is contrary to traditional self-emptying docks that tend to be loud and are prone to frequent clogging.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
###  EdgeSwing™ Dual Scrubbing and Scrubbing Mops

 The unique shape of Narwal’s mops allows for more effective coverage of corners and edges. This is because the Reuleaux triangle shape maintains a constant width as it rotates, making sure it leaves no streaks between the pads.

 And, with ample downward pressure, stubborn stains are effectively dealt with, ensuring a gleaming finish to your floors. Finally, to ensure no spot is missed, it has EdgeSwingTM mode, a motion that automatically rotates the robot back and forth. While it may look like it's doing “The Twist,” it allows it to reach around and into corners and crevices.

##  Narwal Freo

![Narwal Freo](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2100-freo.png) 

Narwal

 This is Narwal’s original robot vacuum mop and is available with an incredible $800 discount on Prime Day. [What was $1399.99 is just $599.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4D99WGK?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F799F1BD97EA325E4AF191A726066D0C4%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas).It’s still one of the company’s bestsellers, and this huge discount will only reinforce that boast.

 This little android helper is a vacuum and mop that incorporates Narwal’s AI DirtSense™ technology, which assesses the cleanliness of the water used during mopping to detect dirty floor areas. Once detected, the robot returns to problem areas and re-mops until sparklingly clean.

 The base station automatically cleans and dries the mop and features an easy-to-use LCD touchscreen for more control. You can also use the intuitive app for control from your smartphone, and the extended battery life ensures the Narwal Freo is a sound Prime Day purchase.

 The Narwal Freo X Plus is a simplified, budget-friendly version of the Freo X Ultra. It does have many of the innovative features that the X Ultra has, such as industry-leading suction power, the Zero-Tangle Floating Brush and the excellent dust-compression system.

 However, this model comes without a base station, although it does have a built-in 280 ml clean-water tank. It can mop over 4,800 sq ft (450 sq meters) before needing refilling. This means your exertions are still at a minimum, and with a 7,800 Pa suction and a 6N downward pressure when mopping, there’s ample power to keep your carpets and floors fresh and clean.

 The [Narwal X Plus is available at an eye-catching $279.99 on Prime Day](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRFV7DPC?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F1E6FE09B14ABFCCAA7D58184F77F96AB%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas). That’s almost a $120 discount on the original $399.99 price.

##  S10 Pro Wet & Dry Vacuum Mop

![Narwal-S10 Pro](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2100-s10-pro.png) 

Narwal

 The Narwal S10 Pro is a lightweight but robust self-propelling wet & dry vacuum mop packed with the latest Narwal technology. It’s a device to use to get sparkling floors with an edge-to-edge clean and is perfect for dealing with sudden mishaps and heavy-duty spills.

 It features 32 running-water streams that produce a 17N mopping pressure and a 14,000 Pa suction with 76AW efficiency. That’s quite some power for a device that weighs less than 10lbs.

 Its rotating handle means that you can quickly adjust to horizontal or vertical positions to help you get into those low spaces and tight corners.

 Additionally, your exertion is minimal with this self-propelling vacuum mop. It’s comfortable to use for extended periods as it practically glides across floors with minimal user effort.

 By utilizing Narwal’s AI DirtSense™ tech, the S10 can gauge the dirt level on the floor and display the information on its color LCD screen. It will adjust its suction power and water dispensing levels in accordance with the results and seamlessly switch through its five cleaning levels as needed.

 Furthermore, the S10 effectively separates solid and liquid waste, so there’s little need to consider what it’s picking up. Finally, it also self-cleans and dries on its return to the dock after a busy day of cleaning.

[This Prime Day, it's available at a bargain $299.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPSR57DC?maas=maas%5Fadg%5FDD652923B4257DE32CDDA327159D51CD%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas). That's almost a $130 saving on the original $429.99 price.
