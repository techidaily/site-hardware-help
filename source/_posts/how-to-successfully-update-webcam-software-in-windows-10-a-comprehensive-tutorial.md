 AMD Radeon HD 7800 series desktop graphics cards is designed for gamers who have high expectation of their PC performance and video quality. If you want to keep your PC at its tip-top performance, it is very important that you update your device drivers regularly, especially your display card driver.
  
 In this post, we will be introducing three very effective ways to update your Radeon HD 7850 graphics card driver.
  
[**Method One: Update via Device Manager**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Two: Reinstall graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Three: Update manually (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/radeon-hd-7850-graphics-driver-download-update-on-windows-10/#3)
  
 **Method One: Update via Device Manager**
  
 1) Press**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Device Manager** from the list of choice.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_58633bb7037e2.jpg)
  
 5) Then wait for Windows to get the latest version of the graphics driver it can find for you.  
  
 If you see the notification:  
  
 **Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date.**
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_58633c3acc5d9.png)

 It means that Windows cannot locate the latest version of the graphics card driver for you, so you might need to consider an alternative to get your graphics card driver updated.
  
 **Method Two: Reinstall graphics card driver**
  
**Note** : To reinstall the graphics card driver, you need to know for sure the model of your graphics card.
  
 1) Go to **AMD support** website. Scroll down a little bit to locate**Radeon HD 7000 series** section. Then choose the operating system that you are with accordingly. We choose **Windows 10 (64-bit)** .
