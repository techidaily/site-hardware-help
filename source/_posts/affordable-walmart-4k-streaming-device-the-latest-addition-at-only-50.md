## Affordable Walmart 4K Streaming Device: The Latest Addition at Only $50

If your TV doesn't have a good built-in streaming experience, or you prefer to use an external device anyway, there are a few different streaming devices to choose from. Walmart's Onn Google TV 4K Pro offers a powerful 4K experience without spending a lot of money, but availability has been limited over the past few weeks. Now, you can finally buy it online nationwide.

 Walmart has expanded the availability of its [Onn Google TV 4K Pro Streaming Device](https://www.walmart.com/ip/onn-Google-TV-4K-Pro-Streaming-Device-New-2024-4K-UHD-resolution-Dolby-Vision-Dolby-ATMOS-Hands-Free-Voice-Control-Smart-Hub/5193222892), now offering nationwide shipping. Previously, the device was only available in stores or for local pickup/delivery, and you were limited to seeing whether the device was available in-store at your nearest Walmart location. You might not see it available for shipping to your location just yet, but eventually, it should be available for everyone in the United States.

 Priced at $50, the Onn Google TV 4K Pro is a competitively priced option compared to [similar devices](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/android-call-history-recovery-recover-deleted-call-logs-from-poco-x5-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/) from the likes of Roku or Google. This marks a shift from Walmart's previous strategy of offering budget-friendly 4K streamers under $20, and for what it's worth, this is probably one of the better "premium" streaming devices available out there. The Onn 4K Pro boasts features like 4K UHD picture quality, Dolby Vision and Dolby Audio, hands-free voice control with Google Assistant, a remote finder, and fast Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. It also provides access to over 700,000 movies and shows across various streaming platforms, as well as 800+ free live TV channels.

 The device's specifications include a quad-core Cortex-A55 CPU, Mali-G31 MP2 GPU, 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, and a USB 3.0 port. It also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for an improved viewing experience. Whether consumers will opt for this device over slightly pricier but more powerful options remains to be seen—this is undercutting options such as the Roku Ultra, which has a $100 MSRP but can be found at about $80\. However, the fact that this device is becoming more widely available should make more people consider it, especially given it has basically everything you could ask of a streaming device for cheap.

 You can [buy the Onn Google TV 4K](https://www.walmart.com/ip/onn-Google-TV-4K-Pro-Streaming-Device-New-2024-4K-UHD-resolution-Dolby-Vision-Dolby-ATMOS-Hands-Free-Voice-Control-Smart-Hub/5193222892) now from Walmart, with online shipping or in-store pickup at select locations.
