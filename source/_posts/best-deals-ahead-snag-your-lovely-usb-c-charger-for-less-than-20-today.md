## Best Deals Ahead: Snag Your Lovely USB-C Charger for Less Than $20 Today!

Add a bit of fun to your outlet with this [USB-C charger](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/freedom-in-viewing-is-vlc-more-powerful-than-mpc-for-2024/), which you can pick up now for under $20.

 I've talked about [liking novelty chargers](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionize-recording-the-ultimate-guide-to-minecraft-screenshots-on-mac-for-2024/) in the past. They're neat! Why have boring, normal plugs when you can have a [cute Macintosh](https://drop.com/buy/retro-pc-gan-fast-charger) smiling at you and lighting up when you plug something in it? A cool little quirky charger likely won't cost you more than a standard one, and often offers quick charging for your devices.

 So it's even better when one of these chargers is on sale! At Walmart, you can get the [UGREEN Nexode Robot GaN Charger Block](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2005072&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F5085800962) for just $18.99, $21 off the normal asking price of $39.99\. This cute little robot has one USB-C port on the top of its head, and its feet hide and protect the wall plug when not in use. There are also two versions—a [black and gray](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2005072&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F5085800962) robot charger, and a [white and purple](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2005072&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F5087016170) one. Both are $18.99, so you can choose the one you like better and still save!

 You may wonder if this charger is even worth the money, but we've [reviewed this little device](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/tech-savvy-tips-for-downloading-youtube-playlists-fast/) and loved it:

 It’s easy to get hung up on the gimmicky face that takes up much of the charger’s surface area. I had an initial gut reaction to it, having handled countless low-quality electronics that delivered subpar performance but were imbued with some sort of eye-catching albeit pointless feature. This isn’t one of those devices, though, and the main focus of Ugreen’s Robot GaN charger is definitely its output.

 So, for under $20, why not pick one of these chargers up? At worst, you'll have a little robot cube decoration you can use as a charger in a pinch. That's less than I've spent on many of my desk decorations, that's for sure.
