## Buying a New Laptop? Choose From the Latest Snapdragon Elite X Series with Integrated Microsoft Copilot Now Available

Several PC manufacturers recently[launched Qualcomm-powered laptops](https://tools.techidaily.com) and many models are hitting store shelves and shipping out from today. These[Copilot+ PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) come with Arm-based[Snapdragon X chips](https://tools.techidaily.com) featuring a 45 TOPS NPU and have new AI-powered features,[like Paint’s Cocreator](https://tools.techidaily.com) , as well as access to the controversial Windows Recall feature that’s been relegated[to Windows Insiders](https://tools.techidaily.com) only.

 Although these new Copilot+ PCs are only getting a few new features to start with, other third-party apps like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, DaVinci Resolve Studio, CapCut, and more will use the built-in NPUs on these computers to run AI features locally. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Arm-based processors of these chips means we’re finally getting Windows laptops that can compete with the legendary battery life of Apple-silicon-powered MacBooks.

 So, if you’re in the market for a new Windows laptop and want to get in on the AI bandwagon, these are the Snapdragon X laptops launching today or in the next few weeks.

## Acer Swift 14 AI

 The Swift 14 AI is Acer’s bet on the Copilot+ PC, and it can be had with either a Snapdragon X Plus or Snapdragon X Elite chip. It also has a 75Wh battery, which the company claims will give the laptop up to 26 hours of battery life. You can also spec it with as much as 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.

 The XPS 13 is one of the most popular Windows laptops around, and it’s one of the first[Dell](https://tools.techidaily.com) machines to get the Copilot+ PC brand. The XPS 13 is only available with Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100 chip, but you can spec it with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM. You can even get it with a 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD.

 The biggest advantage of the XPS 13 is the screen options available: it starts with a 13.4-inch display with an FHD+ resolution, but you can upgrade it to a QHD+ display. But if you want the best image quality, the XPS 13 can be had with a 3K OLED screen. The XPS 13 starts at $1,299.99 but can quickly jump to $2,499.99 if you max out its specs.

 Of course,[Microsoft](https://tools.techidaily.com) will not lag behind the competition when it comes to Copilot+ PCs.
