## Step-by-Step Fixes to Your Realtek ALC887 HD Audio Woes on a Windows Computer

If you want to download and install the**Realtek ALC887 driver** on your Windows computer, you’ve come to the right place! This post shows you how to fix the driver issue by installing the Realtek ALC8878 driver.

## Try these methods

There are two ways you can update your Realtek ALC887 driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Usually Realtek keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the Realtek website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 So you can head to the[Realtek website](https://www.realtek.com/) , search the driver for Realtek ALC887\. If you couldn’t find the result for the driver you need, you can contact Realtek support for further assistance.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
