 4\. Then you can follow the on-screen and step-by-step instructions to download the drivers for your Epson printer. To download right drivers, you are required to use your printer model name and the specific operating system (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit ). **Note:**For older printer products, Epson may not provide Windows 10 drivers.
