 If you’re seeking compatible drivers for your **[ASUS ROG Maximus X Hero Motherboard](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-MAXIMUS-X-HERO/)**  , then this post is written for you. No matter what components you have on the motherboard, you’ll be able to find the correct drivers for them with a few simple steps.

## How to update your Maximus X Hero drivers

 First of all, you should know that there’s no particular driver for a motherboard, but there are drivers for motherboard devices. For more details of what motherboard is and how to update motherboard drivers, you may take a look at **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Some of the most common motherboard drivers include chipset drivers, network card drivers, audio drivers, video drivers and so on. When you try to update these drivers manually for your ASUS ROG Maximus X Hero motherboard, you should be well clear about their specifications first.

Here we recommend you two ways to update the drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  

 OR  

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-update-asus-maximus-x-hero-drivers-quick-easy/#option2) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Update the drivers manually

 ASUS keeps updating drivers for the ROG Maximus X Hero motherboard. To get them, you need to visit the download website of ASUS, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. Here’s what you’re supposed to do:

1. Go to the **[download webpage](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-MAXIMUS-X-HERO/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  of ASUS ROG Maximus X Hero motherboard.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. On the pop-up page, click the**down arrow button** to the right of**Please select OS** to expand its drop-down list, as illustrated below. Then select your version of the Windows operating system.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-303.png)

3. Then you’ll be presented with a list of drivers available for download.**Note** that not all of them are drivers; some are just useful pieces of software which you may download as well.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-304.png)
4. When you decide to download a certain kind of driver, say the audio driver, simply click the**DOWNLOAD** button next to it. You can find more versions (if there’s any) of the desired driver by clicking**See All Downloads** . Then choose one of them to download based on your own situations.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-306.png)
5. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
6. **Reboot** your computer for the changes to take effect even if you’re not asked to.

 Repeat Step 1 through Step 6 until you finish downloading and installing all the drivers you need. This may seem a bit time-consuming and error-prone, though. If you’re interested in the benefits of updating drivers automatically with a driver updater tool, read on and find out how.
