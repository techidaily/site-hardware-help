## What is the Pioneer DJ DDJ-SX2 and why you need its driver

 The Pioneer DJ DDJ-SX2 is the first controller to provide DJ with the latest upgrades to the native operating software. It is the successor to the DDJ-SX. By adding multi-colored performance pad LEDs and with the four-channel controller, its build on the popularity of its predecessor. It also has dedicated controls for the Serato Flip expansion pack, makes it do better work.

 But if you want it to work properly, you will need correct and up to date drivers. Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.
