 The Epson WF 2630 driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with your printer.

 If the driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer, your printer won’t fully function. So, when something goes wrong with your Epson WF-2630 printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

There are 2 ways you can do it:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically update the Epson WF2630 driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Option 2 – Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### **Option 1 – Automatically update** the Epson WF 2630 **driver** with Driver Easy

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the Epson WF-2630 driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
