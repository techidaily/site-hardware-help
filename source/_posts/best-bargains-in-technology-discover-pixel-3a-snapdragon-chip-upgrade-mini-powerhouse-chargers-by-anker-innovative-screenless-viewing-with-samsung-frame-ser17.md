## Best Bargains in Technology: Discover Pixel 3A-Snapdragon Chip Upgrade, Mini Powerhouse Chargers by Anker, Innovative Screenless Viewing with Samsung Frame Series

If you're looking for a deal on your next gadget or gift, here are the best discounts available on all sorts of goodies this week. Save on Google's Pixel 7a, wireless earbuds, smart lights, a retro vinyl record player, and more.

 Google will likely announce a new Pixel 8a budget smartphone in May, but last year's Pixel 7a is still an excellent phone, especially at an [all-time low price of $349](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002734&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Ftop-tech-deals-cheap-pixel-7a-anker-charger-samsung%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). Score Samsung's stunning 75-inch "The Frame" TV for nearly 40% off, PC accessories, or get a waterproof portable speaker for the pool or beach.

Google's latest Pixel 7a smartphone is a bargain at its usual price, but Amazon is offering it at the lowest price we've seen yet. 

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002734&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Ftop-tech-deals-cheap-pixel-7a-anker-charger-samsung%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) 

 We've seen the Pixel 7a drop to under $380 several times over the last few months, but with a new model around the corner, it's getting one of its steepest discounts yet. Yes, the [Pixel 7a is only $349](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002734&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Ftop-tech-deals-cheap-pixel-7a-anker-charger-samsung%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).
