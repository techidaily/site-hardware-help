## Review of the Satechi Qi2: A Game-Changing Foldable Stand with Robust Desktop Performance in a Portable Package

### Key Takeaways

* Satechi's 2-in-1 charging stand offers both home use and portability at a reasonable $79.99 price point.
* The stand's simple design conceals its functionality, supporting fast charging for iPhones and AirPods without overheating.
* Lightweight and portable, it folds flat and weighs only 0.6 lb, making it a convenient travel companion, but lacks sufficient non-slip pads.

 Most products that try to be a jack of all trades end up being a master of none. However, [Satechi’s 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand](https://satechi.net/products/2-in-1-foldable-qi2-wireless-charging-stand) is an exception that does a swell job as both a desk staple and a portable charger.

##  A Simple Design That Does It All

![Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand folded on a table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/53678323081_aa4a51c45f_o.jpg)

 There’s nothing flashy about this charging stand at first glance, but look under the proverbial hood and you’ll find it makes up for this in execution.

 What immediately struck me when testing this product was how small a footprint it left on my desk compared to other charging stands I’ve used and reviewed. Everything—including my iPhone 15 Pro Max—fit safely within the perimeter of the stand’s square base, while the arm held my phone at a suitable viewing angle. The iPhone’s charging pad sits on a hinge which allows its viewing angle to be adjusted to your liking. Both this hinge and the one at the base of the arm are sturdy enough that it takes reasonable force to move them.

 The 15W Qi2 iPhone charging pad offers the fast-charging capabilities also boasted by its competitors, which is to say it’ll get your phone juiced up quickly. [Qi2 is an open standard](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-fake-following-fiasco-avoiding-illusory-supporters-in-social-media-space/) based on Apple’s MagSafe technology that you’ll find in most modern wireless chargers. It's currently only supported by Apple’s phones, though other manufacturers may adopt it with future models.

 The same expectations extend to the standard 5W charging pad for AirPods cases located in the base. It’s noteworthy that both the iPhone and AirPods pads overheated my devices to a significantly lesser degree than other chargers I’ve reviewed, even if they aren’t altogether free from that issue.

 Where this 2-in-1 charging stand shines is its portability. It folds completely flat and weighs just over half a pound, making it an ideal travel companion. It’s perfect for traveling between your home and office, or to a hotel room. There are chargers aimed exclusively at portability that are heavier and larger than Satechi’s, which makes their design quite an accomplishment.

##  Be Aware of These Shortcomings

![Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand charging an iPhone and Airpods from the side](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/53677454192_b8994bf3a7_o.jpg)

 There is a price paid by making this charging stand lightweight, however. It’s prone to slip around desks due to insufficient non-slip pads and a general lack of heft. It’s an issue I quickly came to live with, but it still led to a product that felt flimsier than it should.

 The LED light on the front of the base is also a missed opportunity. Whereas most chargers use this light to indicate the charge status of AirPods, this one remains on at all times to indicate that the stand is receiving power. Considering this is already obvious by way of whether your devices are charging, it serves no necessary function.

 It was also a letdown that there was no power adapter included in the box. Not everywhere you go will have a USB-C port, limiting the stand’s use cases unless you provide your own power adapter. [I used Anker’s superb 735 Charger](https://howto.techidaily.com/gmail-not-working-on-lava-blaze-2-5g-7-common-problems-and-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) ($39.99) myself, but I would’ve preferred Satechi to include one of their own.

##  Should You Buy a Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand?

![Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand with accessories and box](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/53677454147_9dc2702dc6_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 The shortcomings of the [Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand](http://satechi.net/products/2-in-1-foldable-qi2-wireless-charging-stand) are largely outweighed by its dual-purpose design. This is a stand that gets the essentials right with quality execution. It has a reasonable price, comparatively, of $79.99, especially as it fulfills the roles of multiple categories in this space.

 It’s therefore easy to recommend this charger if your needs call for both home use and portability. Just know that you’ll need to use your own power source if you don’t already own one, which adds another cost​​​​​​.
