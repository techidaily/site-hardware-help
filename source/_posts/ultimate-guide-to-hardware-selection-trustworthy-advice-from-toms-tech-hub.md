## Gigabyte's Ultrawide 49-Inch Aorus OLED Monitor for Gamers - Price Slashed to a Record Low of $969

A lot of gaming setups commonly include a dual or even triple monitor formation with a primary monitor for your game and support monitors for chat applications or maybe a YouTube guide video. The benefit of an ultrawide gaming monitor is that it's like having dual monitors seamlessly squished together for a panoramic viewing experience, but with fewer cables and less clutter (monitor arms and stands) on your desk.

 The Aorus CO49DQ has plenty of connection inputs with two HDMI 2.1 ports with CEC support, a DisplayPort 1.4 port, 1 x USB Type-C, and 2 x Type-A USB 3.2 pass-through ports. A headphone jack and two 5W speakers are also built into the chassis. The stand has swivel and tilt adjustment, but no height adjustment, but with 100 x 100 VESA mounting there's always the option to get a third-party arm or desk mount to provide additional adjustment options.

 See our[review of the Gigabyte Aorus CO49DQ](https://tools.techidaily.com) for more details. This monitor impressed us with its stunning image quality, contrast, and amazing build quality. Our only wish was that it would support higher than 144Hz refresh rates.
