### Option 1 – Download and install the Microsoft Bluetooth driver manually

 Microsoft keeps releasing new drivers for its Bluetooth devices. To get them, you need to go to the **[Microsoft download center](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/downloads)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
