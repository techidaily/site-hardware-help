##  The Other Stuff

 The European Union [announced its preliminary view](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/eu-accuses-apple-violating-dma-rules/) earlier this week that Apple is violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA), by charging fees for developers publishing apps outside the App Store and other anti-competitive practices. Apple was required to [open up iPhones in the EU](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-samsung-galaxy-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) earlier this year to allow third-party app stores (or “digital marketplaces”), but iPhones in other parts of the world remain locked down.

 In other news, [the United States government has banned Kaspersky](https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-ban-us-sales-kaspersky-software-over-ties-russia-source-says-2024-06-20/), the company best known for Kaspersky Antivirus, from selling its software in the US. Kaspersky is based in Russia, and the Biden administration is worried about its software committing espionage and distributing malware, since its antivirus software has elevated permissions on many computers. You’re probably fine with just Windows Defender, anyway.
