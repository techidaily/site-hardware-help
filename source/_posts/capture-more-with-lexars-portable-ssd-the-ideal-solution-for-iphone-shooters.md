## Capture More with Lexar's Portable SSD - The Ideal Solution for iPhone Shooters

Lexar is releasing a portable SSD for expanding storage on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. The Professional Go SSD is designed for videographers and photographers who need extra storage to film on their iPhones. But it also works with most Android phones as a general storage expansion device.

 The upcoming portable SSD connects with the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max through the USB-C port without any wires. You can either attach it to the bottom of your phone or clip it on the back using the angled connector. At less than 2 inches in length and half an ounce, it seems to be compact and lightweight enough to stay out of the way.

 Under the hood, the Professional Go SSD comes with 1TB or 2TB of storage, promised to operate at 1050 MB/s read and 1000 MB/s write speeds. It has some light dust and water resistance, rated IP65\. Plus, it can survive a 1-meter drop.

 Apple’s ProRes format is excellent for editing, but it also burns through the storage pretty fast. That’s why Apple caps the frame rate at 4K 30fps to compensate. With the Professional Go SSD, you can record 4K videos at 60fps directly to its external storage.

 The Lexar Professional Go SSD also comes with a dock called Hub for accessories. It has extra USB ports for connecting to the microphone, lighting, and charging equipment. It starts from $189 for the 1TB version and $299 for the 2TB variant. If you want the Hub with the SSD, it’ll set you back $239 for the 1TB variant. The Hub and 2TB portable SSD bundle costs $349\. There’s an early bird discount of up to 33% for people who back this product on Kickstarter.

 You can [order the drive on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lexar/lexar-professional-go-portable-ssd-with-hub?ref=project%5Flink). Lexar will begin shipping the Go SSD and Hub next month. Lexar is a 27-year-old well-known brand, so its promotional campaign shouldn’t have the risks involved with backing products on Kickstarter.
