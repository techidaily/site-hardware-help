##  The Chair Is Comfortable, Plain and Simple

Tyler Hayes / How-To Geek

 Whether you’re looking for a gaming chair or one for the office, the TC500 Luxe is a chair that can do all kinds of desk tasks. It doesn’t care what you’re doing at the desk, its aim is just to be comfortable and supportive. After weeks of testing, I can confirm it hit those marks.

 The TC500 Luxe is a joy to sit in and has been much better than the last three desk chairs I’ve used. The foam cushioning is mostly firm with a touch of squish to it. Its seat and back are wider than I needed and never made me feel cramped.

 The adjustments are manual and relatively minimal but still comprehensive. I didn’t need more luxuries than the up-and-down or in-and-out moveable lumbar support, 160-degree reclining, and a wide turning radius of the arms. (Of course, the chair's height moves up and down and can tilt back or be locked in place.)

Close 

 I didn’t realize I wanted a magnetic headrest pillow, but I’ve loved having one on this chair. Even though it can be removed easily just by pulling at it, it never once came loose on its own. I also never felt the urge to remove it. I liked leaning back and feeling its soft and cushioned material.

 Speaking of material, a soft, suede-like fabric graces the entire chair, save for the arms. It adds to the comfort and is mostly nice. The caveat is that the material can be warm after several hours. It will feel nice during the colder months, but summer could be a sweaty problem.

##  There Are Strange Flaws

Close 

 Although the soft fabric across the entire chair feels nice to sit on, I have a few qualms about it. The biggest of which is that, unlike a holey, mesh chair, this one doesn’t breathe well. People who run hot may not be crazy about the potential heat build-up.

 Semi-related to the material, the “Frost” color option may not be the best choice, even if you prefer a light color. It looks dirty in person. Up close, you can easily see the texture and the slightly distressed look the company was going for. Unfortunately, that little bit of off-color texture gives the white chair a dirty look from further away and different angles. Had I realized this ahead of time, I might have chosen the black “Shadow” color.

 Apart from the warmth and color concerns, I was disappointed to see some scratches on the black plastic arms and unfavorable stitching around some seams of the fabric. It wasn’t bad enough to go through the hassle of a return, but it made me severely question the $500 price tag.

 I noticed all the tiny flaws with the chair as I was trying to put it together without instructions. A word of warning: there are no physical instructions in the box. There is a QR code on one of the box flaps, but I didn’t see that until I was recycling the box.

 Assembly isn’t too tricky, but I wish Corsair would put some effort into shrinking the instructions down to a single piece of paper, for environmental reasons, rather than forgo anything in the box altogether.

 When I look at the [Corsair TC500 Luxe](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/gaming-chairs/cf-9010066-ww/tc500-luxe-gaming-chair-shadow-cf-9010066-ww) gaming chair I’m constantly reminded that the Frost color isn’t ideal and that there are some potential quality control issues, but every time I sit down, those concerns disappear. Undeniably, it’s a comfortable chair I’ve been able to live in for large chunks of the day at my desk.

 I’m a big fan of the magnetic pillow, the manual lumbar support is comprehensive enough, and its extensive reclining capabilities come in handy. The most notable concern might be that its fabric gets warm. The $500 price isn’t high in the world of office chairs, but it is still a big investment. Especially if it’s going to make you sweat for part of the year.
