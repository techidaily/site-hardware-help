 Manufacturers and carriers often pre-install a bunch of apps on Android phones. If you don't use them, they just clutter your system and drain your battery in the background. Take control of your device and stop the bloatware.

##  Uninstalling vs. Disabling Bloatware

 You have a few choices when it comes to removing bloatware from your system. [Uninstalling](https://howto.techidaily.com/9-solutions-to-fix-honor-x50-gt-system-crash-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) an app is exactly what it sounds likeâ€”the app is entirely removed from your device. This is only possible for "non-essential" apps.

 You can't uninstall a system app. These are typically apps like the phone, calendar, messaging, file manager, etc. Removing them could make the phone malfunction, which is why it's not possible without extreme measures. What constitutes a "system" app depends on the device. Sometimes you can't even uninstall the calculator.

 Apps that could cause issues if they were fully uninstalled can sometimes be "disabled." A disabled app is still installed on the device, but it can't be opened or run in the background. For practical purposes, it's "uninstalled," just not technically.

 Still, not all apps can be disabled, either. For example, the phone app and messaging app are typically unable to be disabled. The manufacturer doesn't want you to end up without them.

##  How to Remove Bloatware on Android

 First, swipe down from the top of the screen (once or twice, depending on your device) and tap the gear icon to open the Settings menu.

 You may need to tap "See All \[Number\] Apps" for the full list of installed apps. Some devices show the full list right away.

 On the app info page, you'll either see the option to "Uninstall" or "Disable." Tap it to remove the app.

!["Disable" or "Uninstall."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2022-06-22_16-31-06.png) 

 A pop-up will ask you to confirm that you want to uninstall or disable the app. Tap "OK" or "Disable App" to proceed.

 If the app can't be disabled, the option will be grayed out.

 That's all there is to it. To re-enable an app, visit this page again and tap "Turn On" or "Enable."

![Tap "Turn On."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2022-06-22_16-31-56.png) 

 As mentioned, uninstalled apps will be completely removed and you'll either need to [re-install from the Play Store](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/enhancements-made-in-the-latest-fix-for-football-manager-2020-reliable-performance-guaranteed/) or [sideload the APK](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-premium-quality-streaming-on-the-worlds-largest-network/). Disabled apps are still on the device. Hopefully, you don't have too much bloatware to remove.
