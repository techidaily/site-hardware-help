## What are Targus DisplayLink drivers?

 To answer this question, we must explain each of the three words separately.**Targus** is a manufacturer of computer-related products from laptop bags to universal docking stations while**DisplayLink** is a chip and software company whose technology is used in many products. And a**driver** , to put it simply, is an invisible bridge that connects hardware and software. Without drivers, most of your hardware devices cannot run properly.

 Honestly speaking, there’s no such thing as “Targus DisplayLink driver”, but there are certain drivers designed for a Targus device (such as a docking station) that adopts the DisplayLink technology. For example, Targus Dock 190 is one of the featured products using the DisplayLink technology.
