## Why you need Behringer USB audio drivers?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 You can download Behringer drivers from Behringer. To get them, you need to go to the [Behringer website](https://www.behringer.com/Categories/c/Behringer/Downloads) , find the drivers corresponding with your system and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
