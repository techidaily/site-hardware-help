## Android Gaming on Par with Consoles: 15 Visually Stunning Titles You Can't Miss

Android smartphones have become so powerful that they can now run mobile games that look a lot like console games. In some cases, phones can actually run older console titles. So, if you want to experience console-grade graphics on your phone, here's a list of our favorite Android games.

## 1 [Minecraft](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe) 

 Of all games ported from PC and consoles, _Minecraft_ is one of the few that's a stone's throw from the original. It's hard to imagine that people initially made fun of Minecraft's pixelated graphics, as the art style has proven that it's absolutely timeless.

 The graphics look amazing out of the box, but if you really want to push the eye candy, you can turn the render distance to maximum to experience a near-endless horizon filled with Minecraft's blocky world. The mobile version even supports custom texture packs and skins, so you can make it look even better than it already is.

## 2 [SpongeBob SquarePants BfBB](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.bfbb) 

 The Android version of _Battle for Bikini Bottom_ is actually the "Rehydrated" version released in 2020 for consoles and PC, which is a faithful remake of the 2003 original. It largely maintains the same quality of high-fidelity graphics. This platformer is a rare instance where developers successfully recreated a 2D cartoon as a 3D game without it looking janky.

## 3 [Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nebulajoy.act.dmcpoc) 

 As one of the youngest entries on our list, _Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat_ is bound to have some of the best graphicsâ€”and it shows. It's a mobile-only Devil May Cry game that preserves the swagger and stunning hack-and-slash visuals you expect from the franchise. The insanely detailed animations, in particular, are breathtaking, and the reason why I wrote this article is because they're _that_ good, even on the lowest settings.

## 4 [Genshin Impact](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/search?q=genshin+impact&c=apps) 

 While _Genshin Impact_ isn't everyone's cup of tea, you can't say that it's a bad-looking game. The anime-inspired art style packs vibrant cel-shaded graphics and animations reminiscent of the latest Zelda games. Genshin Impact also has meticulously detailed characters and clothes.

 It's worth noting that Genshin Impact supports cross-platform gameplay. So, it's basically the same game as on PC and PlayStation, albeit with downgraded graphics so that the game can run on a mobile processor.

## 5 [Call Of Duty: Mobile](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.callofduty.shooter) 

 It's hard to make FPS games that look great on mobile, but _Call of Duty: Mobile_ somehow manages to pull it off. While textures leave a lot to be desired, the game has best-in-class lighting and shadows that bring the game to life. The game even supports bloom, which is the visual effect that makes light sources spill beyond their borders. This makes the sun look far more realistic than a simple white circle in the sky.

## 6 [The Room: Old Sins](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FireproofStudios.TheRoom4) 

_The Room: Old Sins_ is the fourth entry in a long-running franchise that was originally released for iOS but is now available on Android, PC, and the Nintendo Switch as well. While all _The Room_ games look great, the graphics here have been polished to perfection. The sheer volume of detailed textures isn't what you typically see in puzzle games, but The Room has always been an exception. You spend a lot of time staring at the screen to find hidden clues and artifacts, which I'd gladly do when a game has such amazing textures and models.

## 7 [XCOM 2 Collection](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feralinteractive.xcom2%5Fandroid) 

_XCOM 2 Collection_ is a turn-based tactics game where aliens rule the Earth relatively peacefully, but you control a squad called XCOM with the goal of liberating humanity. The Collection has the base game and four DLCs, and the graphics here are almost just as good as on PC. The game wasn't downgraded for mobile, but it still runs smoothly.

 XCOM 2 Collection was ported to Android by Feral Interactive, the same developer that worked on a few other games from our list, _GRID Autospor_t and _Alien Isolation_. Their ports of PC and console games look great but also require a powerful smartphone to run, which is understandable given how good their games look.

## 8 [GRID Autosport](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feralinteractive.gridas) 

 Racing games on Android often have captivating graphics and breathtaking atmospheres, but _GRID Autosport_ has been my favorite since it launched back in 2019\. I played GRID Autosport on PC, too, and the Android version looks almost exactly the same.

 GRID Autosport is newer and looks even better than _Need for Speed: No Limits_ and _Real Racing 3_, two other racing games with amazing graphics. The game has over 100 cars with detailed car models, liveries, and a healthy selection of circuits, so you're definitely getting your money's worth with this triple-A title.

## 9 [Alien: Isolation](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feralinteractive.alienisolation%5Fandroid) 

 If you're a fan of survival horror games, _Alien: Isolation_ is the one to get. The humans and disgusting aliens you encounter on the Sevastopol space station are incredibly convincing. I can't think of any other Android game with character models that are this good. The amazing lighting effects enhance the space station's liminality to make it look even more impressive and creepy.

## 10 [Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7086639890153802127) 

_GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition_ is a collection of three classic GTA games that have received a graphics overhaul to bring them up to modern standards. While it had a rocky launch on PC and consoles, most issues have been fixed now, and the games got ported to Android in 2023\. You can play them with a Netflix subscription for free, but you can also buy them for $19.99 per game; I recommend the former.

 Most textures and character models have been updated, and it's especially noticeable in the two older games, _GTA III_ and _GTA: Vice City_. The gameplay is exactly what you expect from GTAâ€”endless fun in the open-world sandbox and amazing story-driven missions.

## 11 [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/mobile/android/new-device) 

_Fortnite_ is one of the few triple-A games that you can play cross-platform with PC and console players. While the graphics have been adjusted for mobile, it's the same exact Battle Royale fun. It has a colorful, goofy art style with amazing skins, many of which are licensed from other IPs. If you played Fortnite but quit, you should [give it another shot](https://discover-alternatives.techidaily.com/seamless-workflow-enhancement-uniting-abbyy-and-automation-anywhere/), this time on your Android phone.

## 12 [Black Desert Mobile](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pearlabyss.blackdesertm.gl) 

 This behemoth of an MMORPG boasts the most impressive, jaw-dropping spell animations on mobile. _Black Desert Mobile_ features the same anime-inspired character art style as Genshin Impact but with traditional environments. The game is filled with countless hours of content, and since it's multiplayer, it's impossible to get bored.

## 13 [Dead Cells](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.deadcells.mobile) 

_Dead Cells_ is a roguelike, side-scrolling Metroidvania game. It has the most amazing pixelated art style that the developers leveraged to create smooth animations, unique characters, and flashy animations. The environments are pretty cool, too. The latest _Return to Castlevania_ DLC features a new storyline filled with _Castlevania_ characters, werewolves, vampires, and more.

 If you've never played a roguelike, your progress is reset each time you die, but you'll continue to unlock new power-ups with each run. It's a fun genre that you must try at least once, and Dead Cells is one of the best games to experience it.

## 14 [Injustice 2](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.injustice.brawler2017) 

_Injustice 2_ is a fighting game based on the DC Universe. The game follows the same story that the PC and console versions do, but the gameplay has been adapted to mobile. Nevertheless, the graphics are arguably the best of any mobile fighting game, complete with trademark superpowers and popular DC Universe characters.

## 15 [Bendy And The Ink Machine](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003296/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jds.batim) 

_Bendy And The Ink Machine_ has an incredible cel-shaded, cartoon-inspired art style that perfectly fits this paranormal game. It's yet another excellent PC and console port that looks as good on Android as it does on more powerful hardware. You play as Henry, who visits an abandoned workshop filled with ink splotches and creepy animation cutouts. The gameplay is a mix of puzzle-solving, survival, adventure, and classic horror.

---

 This was a tough list to make, as there are countless other amazing-looking Android games that I couldn't include because the Ink Machine sprung a leak. Just kidding. In all seriousness, I tried my best to include a variety of genres and art styles to give you a well-rounded selection to keep things interesting. Have fun gaming!
