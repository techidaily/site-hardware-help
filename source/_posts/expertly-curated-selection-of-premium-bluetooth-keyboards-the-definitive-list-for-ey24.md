##  What to Look for in a Bluetooth Keyboard

 To start, you'll want to ensure your device and keyboard's [Bluetooth](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insta-to-tik-integration-masterclass/) versions match. Bluetooth version compatibility is important because although Bluetooth technology is backward compatible, you'll be limited to the features of the lower version, which can mean worse connectivity.

 Next, try to find Bluetooth keyboards with long-lasting batteries that suit your lifestyle. The featured Bluetooth keyboards come with long-lasting rechargeable or replaceable batteries, some lasting months or years.

 Lastly, ensure that your preferred Bluetooth keyboard is compatible with your device’s operating system, such as Android, iOS, iPadOS, Windows, macOS, or ChromeOS. The best Bluetooth keyboards support multiple operating systems and device switching.

 While these are the most important factors regarding what you need for a Bluetooth keyboard, if you want to know more, you can check out our article about [what to look for in wireless keyboards](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-list-of-lego-stop-motion-producers/).

 The popular [Logitech Pebble Keys 2 K380s Bluetooth Keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Customizable-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4DP7SC/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003486&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is our top pick for the best Bluetooth keyboard. It's an upgrade from the equally popular [Pebble Keys K380](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B0148NPH9I/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003486&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It supports Bluetooth 5.1 and has everything you need for quick and easy pairing, plus stable connections, even when multiple devices are connected.

 This keyboard comes with some new handy shortcuts that were missing from the original Pebble Keys K380, like the Emoji menu, screenshots, and dictation shortcuts. You can customize these functions through the [Logi Options+ app](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus.html) to easily access your favorite features.

 The Pebble Keys 2 K380s provides a laptop-like typing experience with its scooped round keys and familiar QWERTY layout. Plus, it has a longer battery life and sends low-battery notifications, allowing you to type longer. This is helpful if you're always on the go or attending meetings.

 This keyboard is also a great travel companion, thanks to its lightweight and compact design. Wherever you are, you can easily switch between three connected devices, whether they use Windows, macOS, iPadOS, or ChromeOS. You can get it in [tonal graphite](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Customizable-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4DP7SC/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003486&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [tonal rose](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Customizable-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4DP7SC/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003486&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [tonal white](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Customizable-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT4DP7SC/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003486&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Pocket-friendly pricing     | Bluetooth 3.0                     |

| Multi-OS compatibility      |                                   |

 Bluetooth keyboards, even top-notch ones, are generally pretty affordable. If you're on a tight budget but still want a reliable option, we recommend the [Arteck HB030B Bluetooth Keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/Arteck-HB030B-Universal-Bluetooth-Rechargeable/dp/B00X5P8BJO/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003486&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-bluetooth-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). At just over $20, it's perfect for frugal shoppers.

 While the Arteck HB030B uses Bluetooth 3.0 compared to the Pebble Keys 2's newer tech, it has a cool feature that the Pebble Keys 2 lacks—a backlight. This keyboard not only lights up, it offers seven different LED colors with two brightness levels and an auto-sleep feature to save battery life.

 As for battery life, the Arteck HB030B can last up to 6 months if you use it for an average of two hours a day with the backlight off. This is shorter than the Pebble Keys 2, but it should be plenty for most users.

 The Arteck HB030B has rectangular keys, including special function keys, and is equally compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry about. It’s compatible with iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows, though it doesn’t support switching between devices.

### What is the difference between Bluetooth and wireless keyboards?

 The difference between Bluetooth and wireless keyboards is in their mode of connectivity. Bluetooth keyboards connect to devices primarily via the Bluetooth protocol whereas non-Bluetooth wireless keyboards can connect to devices via Wi-Fi or infrared technology. Some Bluetooth keyboards, like the ASUS ROG Strix II 96 Keyboard, support Wi-Fi and USB connectivity.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Can I use Bluetooth without Internet?

 Yes, you can connect your Bluetooth keyboard to another compatible device via Bluetooth without an Internet connection. However, both devices need to be within coverage range of each other. For most Class 2 devices, Bluetooth coverage is approximately 10m (33ft).

### Do I need a Bluetooth adapter to connect my keyboard to my device?

 Bluetooth keyboards with a pair button do not require a Bluetooth adapter. Simply turn on Bluetooth on your device and click **Add device**. If this isn't the case, then you'll need a USB dongle.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Why won't my Bluetooth keyboard connect?

 There are several possible reasons why your Bluetooth keyboard may not connect. Take the following troubleshooting steps to fix it.

 1\. Ensure that Bluetooth is turned on for both devices

 2\. Make sure both devices are discoverable

 3\. If connecting for the first time, make sure both devices are paired

 4\. Confirm that both devices are within the supported Bluetooth range

 5\. Remove the Bluetooth keyboard from your paired devices and add it again

 If these do not work, you may have to contact the manufacturer's support for help.
