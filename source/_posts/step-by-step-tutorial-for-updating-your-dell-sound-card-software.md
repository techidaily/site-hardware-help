### Method 1: Download and update the audio drivers manually

 Windows can provide new drivers through Device Manager. Device Manager is a Windows utility where you can manage the device and the drivers. In Device Manager, you can update the drivers, uninstall the drivers, disable the device, etc. So when you have sound driver issues, you can update the driver via Device Manager.

 To update the sound driver in Device Manager, here’s what you need to do:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** in the run box and click the**OK** button to open Device Manager.
