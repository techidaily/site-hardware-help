### Key Takeaways

* Passive stylus pens work with all devices with capacitive touch screens.
* Active styluses use different technology standards, such as EMR and USI, which limits their compatibility to a short list of supported devices.
* Third-party active styluses don't always work as intended with devices that support the respective technology.

 Looking to get your first stylus pen but aren't sure if it'll work with your device out of the box? Figuring out third-party stylus compatibility can feel like an exercise in confusion. Don't fret. We'll explain stylus compatibility to get you drawing and note-taking in no time.

##  Are Stylus Pens Compatible With Any Device?

 Passive stylus pens, also called capacitive styluses, are compatible with all devices with capacitive touch screens. Capacitive touch screens have a thin layer of conductive material that recognizes inputs made by your finger or, in this case, passive stylus as disturbances in the electric field.

 In other words, a passive stylus pen is a stand-in for your finger. This means that they're not particularly feature-rich or "smart." Passive styluses don't have pressure sensitivity or buttons and can't recognize tilt, limiting their use to primarily note-taking and signatures.

 However, it's another story if we're talking about active styluses that use electricity. They have advanced features, such as customizable buttons, hover cursors, and pressure-sensitive nibs.

 Active stylus pens aren't universally compatible. They typically rely on one of the following proprietary technology standards:

* Bluetooth Low Energy
* Electromagnetic resonance (EMR)
* Active electrostatic (AES)
* Universal Stylus Initiative (USI)
* Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP)

 Some tablets and smartphones support multiple stylus pens that use one of the protocols. EMR styluses are among the most compatible because the sensors are built into the display rather than the stylus. The USI protocol is also compatible across many brands but is mostly limited to Chromebooks. Same story with MPP.

 However, just because a tablet supports a protocol doesn't mean it's guaranteed to work with a respective stylus. Some manufacturers use proprietary technology or have additional features specific to their brand.

##  Brand-Specific Stylus Pens: Premium Experience at a Premium Cost

 Styluses from OEM manufacturers are designed and optimized to work with their devices. OEM styluses are the default choice for most artists for a good reason, despite the higher cost associated with them.

 They're tailored to work seamlessly and generally provide the best user experience â€” hover, tilt, pressure sensitivity, palm rejection, and the built-in buttons work flawlessly. You won't run into any accuracy and build-quality issues, as these styluses have been thoroughly tested with compatible devices before entering the market.

 You should note that just because the stylus and device come from the same brand, it doesn't always mean that they're 100% compatible. For example, the 10th-generation iPad [only works](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) with the 1st-generation Apple Pencil. If you try the 2nd-gen model, it just won't get recognized. And you wouldn't have a way to wirelessly charge the Pencil, anyway.

 So be sure to check the stylus compatibility list of your phone or tablet before buying.

 Another caveat is that you can't always replace it, especially if you have an older device. Some manufacturers don't sell replacement styluses, which makes it hard to find a new one if you break it.

##  Third-Party Stylus Pens: Cheaper, But at What Cost?

 Universal active styluses built by lesser-known manufacturers are the Wild West of the stylus world.

 Third-party styluses give you the opportunity to explore different pen shapes, sizes, features, and nib styles. Some have soft rubber nibs that grip firmly onto the glass surface; others are made of hard plastic that glides freely, perfect for line work and note-taking. The best part is, you can often find them for about half the cost of a first-party stylus.

 Some work precisely as you expect, especially if they're EMR or [USI](https://universalstylus.org/usi-certified-products/) styluses. These technologies were created with compatibility in mind in the first place. If you choose to upgrade your device at some point, you can sometimes continue using the same stylus you've come to love.

 However, these styluses don't always work as expected, even if your device is listed as supported. Some features won't work at all, while others will work but not as intended. Accuracy issues are the worst, as they result in a horrible user experience, leading you to think that all third-party styluses suck.

 The most notorious example is third-party iPad styluses, which often have [wonky pressure sensitivity](https://astropad.com/apple-pencil/) and poor palm rejection support.

##  How to Get the Most Out of Your Third-Party Stylus

 If you don't have a stylus yet, start by doing some research to check what styluses your device supports. If it's a Chromebook with USI, you're in luck, as most compatible styluses work flawlessly.

 If you have an iPad or Android tablet, you can get some decent third-party styluses. Look for one with adjustable sensitivity, calibration, and a long list of supported devices.

 You may also want to consider using different apps. App compatibility is almost as important as device compatibility. Some work perfectly with almost any stylus, whereas others barely even work with the OEM stylus.

 Still, while third-party styluses tend to be a bit cheaper, it's often best to jump for the original brand stylus to get the best experience.
