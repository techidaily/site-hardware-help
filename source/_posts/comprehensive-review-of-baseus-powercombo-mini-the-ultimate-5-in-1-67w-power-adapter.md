### Key Takeaways

* Modular design allows for 3 different uses: USB-C wall charger, extension cord, or travel power strip.
* Compact and convenient at home, but a bit heavy for travel.

 Unlike most power accessories, the [Baseus PowerCombo Mini 5-in-1 Power Strip 67W](https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charging-Detachable-Extension-Essentials/dp/B0CZCQVXXW?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004119&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbaseus-powercombo-mini-5-in-1-power-strip-67w-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is built to have specific uses at home and on the go, instead of in just one place or the other.

##  A Minimal All-In-One Charger

 Just to be clear, the PowerCombo Mini 5-in-1 Power Strip isn’t a traditional power strip. It features one AC outlet on the extension cord, with all the USB ports on the 67W power adapter. When both pieces are connected, it’s a legitimate, full-feature power hub.

 When disconnected, the 5-foot extension portion gains an extra AC outlet (a two-prong one instead of three). And the 4-port USB adapter becomes physically smaller and much lighter.

 That’s one thing I was immediately struck by when taking the 5-in-1 Power Strip out of its box: its total weight. As convenient as it might be, I wouldn’t want to pack the entire unit to take on a short trip. It’s just too heavy with too long of a cable for a weekend getaway.

 On the flip side, it seemed downright small and compact when I used it at my desk. It gave me plenty of power sources without taking up much space. It wasn’t only at my desk, when I used it at home, that it came in handy. I moved the Power Strip to the living room to reach a far outlet and plugged in my dead iPad so I could still work on the couch.

##  The To-Go Aspect Is Neat, But There Are Disappointments

 There are lots of USB power hubs in the shape of a cube or rectangle with an extension cord. Anker’s is probably one of the most popular, but there are plenty out there worth considering—Baseus has made a few in the past too. The problem with those is that they’re bulky to travel with and never get lighter.

 I’m a big fan of how the 5-in-1 Power Strip detaches to create a portable solution. I also like that there are four USB ports. What I’m less crazy about is the division of power between the power adapter’s USB spots.

 First, the USB-A port only handles 5W. Even if that’s the only port being used, it’s stuck at 5W. That’s a bummer. The other three USB-C ports seem to be equal, both from my testing and Baseus’ power breakdown chart. Still, the company decided to put laptop, phone, and tablet icons under the different ports making things a bit confusing for a casual user.

 As far as the power dispersion goes, in short, using one USB-C device can use the full 67W. Two USB-C devices will split 65W, and plugging three USB-C devices in will split 60W. Once you mix in the USB-A’s 5W, you could spend a lot of time studying the chart. All you need to know is that you should always use the USB-C ports, instead of the rectangle one, when possible.

 Besides the potentially confusing power scheme and the disappointing 5W Type-A port, it’s unfortunate that the detachable power adapter can be plugged into the extension cord in the wrong orientation. There are only two ways to plug the adapter into the extension, but the wrong one leaves a noticeable offset between the plastic pieces.

 There’s probably a technical reason it can’t be reversible, but from a consumer’s standpoint, it’s just a little annoying.

 If what you’re looking for is a versatile charger to use at home or away, then the [Baseus PowerCombo Mini 5-in-1 Power Strip 67W](https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charging-Detachable-Extension-Essentials/dp/B0CZCQVXXW?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004119&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbaseus-powercombo-mini-5-in-1-power-strip-67w-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a solid possibility.
