 When it completes downloading, double-click the downloaded driver file to install it on your computer.

 Although downloading the driver from Wacom’s official website is direct and straightforward, it’s not such easy as it is shown and it can be time-consuming.

 Note: If you have no time, no patience or you don’t have the computer skill to find and download the correct driver manually, follow way 2 to let Driver Easy help you then.
