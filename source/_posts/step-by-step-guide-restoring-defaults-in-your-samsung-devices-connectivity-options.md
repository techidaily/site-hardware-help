##  What Happens When You Reset Your Network Settings?

 When you reset your Android phone's network settings, Android [erases all your saved Wi-Fi networks](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ai-assisted-idea-genesis-our-picks-of-the-top-5/), removes paired Bluetooth devices, and deletes other network configurations. This can help resolve the issues caused by your current network settings.
