### **Method 1: Update my Synaptics drivers manually**

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your laptop’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to[**Method 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 To manually update your**Synaptics** drivers:

 First you might need to head to your laptop’s manufacturer’s official website(i.e. the OEM website,like Dell, ASUS etc.) and search the drivers available for your product model. Then  be sure to**ONLY** choose the driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually.

 Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
