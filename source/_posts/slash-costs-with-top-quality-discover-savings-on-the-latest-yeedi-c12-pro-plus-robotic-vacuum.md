## Slash Costs with Top-Quality: Discover Savings on the Latest YEEDI C12 Pro Plus Robotic Vacuum

Robot vacuums and mops are growing more and more advanced with every passing year, but with such a huge number of different robot vacuums and mops to choose from, it can be difficult to cut through the noise and separate the standouts from the so-so.

##  Everything You Need to Know about the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS

 That’s where the [YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS](https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-C12-PRO-PureCyclone-ZeroTangle/dp/B0CZN1VSW9?ref%5F=ast%5Fsto%5Fdp&th=1) comes in. This robot vacuum and mop is the culmination of everything that YEEDI has learned over its many years in the service robot industry.

###  Impressive Suction Power

YEEDI

 The first and most obvious thing to notice about the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is just how effectively it cleans. Driven by an extremely powerful motor that is capable of over 8,000 Pa of suction power, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is capable of cleaning any surface that you might encounter not just easily but effectively.

 Unlike many other robot vacuums and mops, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS has no problem getting particles such as dust, pet food, or other debris out of even the most stubborn surfaces such as carpet crevices.

 This is backed up by the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS’s built-in carpet detection sensor. This sensor allows the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS to detect a carpet and increase its suction power to compensate. Combined with the impressive 8,000 Pa of suction power, this allows the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS to effortlessly clean into even the thickest of rugs and carpets.

YEEDI

 On top of this, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is also an incredibly effective mop. This is thanks to the OZMO Pro 2.0 Vibrating Mopping System that YEEDI has developed and installed on each and every one of these robots.

 This mopping system wipes the floor up to 480 times per minute, which allows the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS to effortlessly move over stubborn stains such as spilled coffee or tomato stains with ease. This vibrating force is applied with a downward pressure of 6 N, which makes this stain removal even more effective for lasting cleanliness and peace of mind.

 On top of this, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS’s built-in carpet detection sensor can also be used when mopping. By detecting rugs and carpets while mopping, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is able to ensure that it never gets your rugs or carpets wet. This also avoids potential cross-contamination, keeping your carpets cleaner than ever before.

###  Hassle-Free Pet Hair Cleaning

YEEDI

 When it comes to a robot vacuum and mop, the entire idea behind its existence is to decrease the burden on yourself and increase the cleanliness of your home. While some other robot vacuums and mops are great at cleaning, they end up actually creating more work for you with all of the maintenance of your robot companion.

 The YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS aims to fix this. Thanks to the introduction of YEEDI’s ZeroTangle technology, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is able to easily clean fallen hair from people and pets alike without any problems.

 The YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS does this by using an anti-static roller brush that is shaped like a V. This is further backed up by an internal structure that features a double comb to allow the hair to pass seamlessly through the robot without any tangling.

 As a result, you won’t have to worry about manually reaching into the rollers and freeing any hair that has gotten stuck yourself. This frees up your time and, more importantly, saves you from the disgusting task of removing the hair by hand.

###  Easy Maintenance Station

YEEDI

 In this same vein, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS also comes with a state-of-the-art Auto-Empty station. This station is where the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS goes to wait and recharge its batteries, but also comes with a wide variety of other features as well.

 For one, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS’s Auto-Empty station offers automatic dust collection and a 4-stage filtration system that works to prevent secondary pollution from occurring while the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS empties the debris that it has accumulated from your home into the station.

 This process is particularly efficient due to YEEDI’s PureCyclone technology, which is able to collect dust and compact it down, which results in the Auto-Emptying station only needing to be emptied every seven weeks or so. On top of this, the bag is clear, making it obvious when the station needs to be emptied at a glance.

 Compared to other alternatives such as traditional bags, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS’s Auto-Emptying station makes the most of an eco-friendly dustbin design that is not only reusable but also washable. This can add up to as much as $144 in savings over three years just on traditional bags alone.

YEEDI

 Additionally, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is capable of easily cleaning just about any space. This is because the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS makes use of TrueMapping technology in order to quickly and easily pathfind around your home, including through difficult or complex scenes such as beneath tables and around corners.

 On top of this, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is completely safe in homes that have differing elevations. In the case of stairs, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is able to avoid falling down them thanks to its bottom-view sensor, and in the case of differing heights, the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS is capable of moving over obstacles up to 20mm high.

 Combine this with the YEEDI C12 PRO PLUS’s built-in 5200 mAh battery, and you have a robot vacuum and mop that is capable of lasting as long as 300 minutes on a single charge when it has to. Perfect for any space or type of home.
