## Unleash Gaming Power: Snag the Alienware Aurora R16 With NVIDIA's RTX 4080 Super and Intel I9 CPU at a $500 Discounted Price

If you're looking to purchase a computer for a family member, or don't know much about building and constructing your own desktop computer, then a prebuilt computer from a company that offers a competent warranty and customer service offers peace of mind. It's not always the cheapest option, but, you're paying for the complete service and not just a box of components.

 Saving a rather tasty $500 off MSRP, you can pick up the[Dell Alienware Aurora R16 for only $2.699](<https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-8900246-12578053%3Fsid%3Dtomshardware-us-1263806631832487988%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdesktop-computers%2Falienware-aurora-r16-gaming-desktop%2Fspd%2Falienware-aurora-r16-desktop%2Fuseahbtsr16igxxd>) . That is still a pretty hefty price tag, but for the money you're getting a powerful Nvidia RTX 4080 Super GPU, 14th Gen Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage inside.

 With such a powerful graphics card and processor, you will have no issues cranking up the graphics settings in your favorite games or any of the very latest AAA games on the market. The Nvidia RTX 4080 Super will give you access to powerful ray tracing capabilities and the latest DLSS-3 frame enhancement software for super-smooth gameplay.
