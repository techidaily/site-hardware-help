### Key Takeaways

* Live wallpapers bring your Android home screen to life by adding movement to your wallpaper. You can use any video or GIF as a live wallpaper.

 Live wallpapers are a fun way to bring your Android home screen to life. However, you're not limited to the ones available in the Play Store. We'll show you how to use any video or GIF as a live wallpaper.

 A live wallpaper is simply a wallpaper that moves, rather than a static image. There's a huge number of live wallpapers available to download, and your device may have come with some pre-loaded as well. But if you have a cool video or GIF that you'd like to see on your home screen, you can turn it into a live wallpaper as well.

##  How to Make a Live Wallpaper on Android

 In order to use a video as a live wallpaper on your Android phone, we'll be using a free app called "[Video (.GIF;.MP4) to Wallpaper](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228135/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koncius.video.wallpaper)" from the Google Play Store. Some Android devices can set videos as wallpaper natively, but this app is simple and works across all devices.

 First, download the app from the Play Store and open it. To get started, tap the (+) button in the bottom right.

 Next, give the wallpaper a name and tap the "Choose" button to locate the .GIF or .MP4 video file on your device.
