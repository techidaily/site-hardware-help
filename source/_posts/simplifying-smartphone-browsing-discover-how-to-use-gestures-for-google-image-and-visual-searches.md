## Simplifying Smartphone Browsing: Discover How to Use Gestures for Google Image and Visual Searches

### Key Takeaways

* Google introduced the "Circle to Search" feature on Android devices, allowing users to circle or tap on the screen to initiate a search.
* The feature can be launched by long-pressing the home button with either three-button navigation or gesture navigation.

 Google is a company that has its eggs in many baskets, but first and foremost, it is a search company. That's why it offers so many different ways to do a Google Search. You can type a query, import images, scan your surroundings, and even hum a song. It's also possible to simply circle stuff on your Android phone's screen to search for it.

 The feature is called "[Circle to Search](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/)," and it was first announced alongside the [Samsung Galaxy S24 series](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-android-video-editors-for-chromebook-top-recommendations/). Circle on Search debuted on the Galaxy S24 series and Pixel 8 series, [starting January 31, 2024](https://blog.google/products/search/google-circle-to-search-android/). A brand new gesture accompanies it on Android devices. We'll show you how it works.

 First, the Circle to Search can be launched with the old [three-button navigation style or gesture navigation](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovation-unveiled-the-complete-moto-z2-review/). If the feature is available on your device, you can activate it by long-pressing the home button or gesture navigation bar. Google Assistant can still be launched by swiping in diagonally from the bottom corner.

 Next, a Google Search bar will appear at the bottom of the screen, and you'll see a message that says, "Circle or tap anywhere to search." Go ahead and do that. If you're trying to select text, tap the text to bring up handles.

 Google will analyze your selection, and the results will slide up from the bottom of the screen. You can add more context to the search by typing in the search bar.

 That's all there is to it! Google wants to make it as painless as possible so you can do as many searches as possible. Sometimes, it's easier to just point at something than try to figure out what to type into Google.
