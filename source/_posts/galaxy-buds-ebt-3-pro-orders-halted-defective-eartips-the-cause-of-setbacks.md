## Galaxy Buds Ebt 3 Pro Orders Halted: Defective Eartips the Cause of Setbacks

We're four and a half days away from the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro launch date. Unfortunately, Samsung now says that it has paused shipments to address a quality control issue. The launch date has shifted to August 28th, though this new date may be tentative.

 Some customers managed to get their hands on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro before Samsung's original July 24th launch date. And while this would normally be a blessing, several "lucky" customers encountered a serious problem—fragile rubber eartips.

 The r/galaxybuds subreddit is full of customers who bought the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro only to be met with defective eartips. It's such a big problem that it's turned into an in-joke; post a picture of your torn eartips, say that you just joined the "[Buds 3 Pro family](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1e6zt2z/just%5Fjoined%5Fbuds%5F3%5Fpro%5Ffamily/)," or the "[Buds 3 Pro club](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1e75be9/welcome%5Fto%5Fthe%5Fbuds%5F3%5Fpro%5Fclub/)," and enjoy the upvotes.

 Samsung says that this "quality control" issue affects a "limited number of early production Galaxy Buds 3 Pro devices." So, shipments are paused until Samsung can conduct a "full quality control evaluation."

> "There have been reports relating to a limited number of early production Galaxy Buds 3 Pro devices … To ensure all products meet our quality standards, we have temporarily suspended deliveries of Galaxy Buds 3 Pro devices to distribution channels to conduct a full quality control evaluation before shipments to consumers take place. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."

 In its statement, Samsung goes on to explain that any customer who has already received their Galaxy Buds 3 Pro preorder should [reach out to customer service](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fcontact%2F) or visit their nearest Samsung Service Center. You can [find nearby service centers](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fservice%2Flocations%2F) by typing your ZIP code into Samsung's support page.

 The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro [pre-order page](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile-audio%2Fgalaxy-buds3-pro%2F) now states that shipping will begin on August 28th. However, we don't know whether the new release date is definitive or tentative. Samsung made no mention of this release date in its [apology email](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Feu.community.samsung.com%2Ft5%2Fwearables%2Fno-buds-3-pro-arriving-today%2Fm-p%2F10279573) to customers, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have been completely removed from Amazon.

 So, while Samsung's busy hunting down defective rubber eartips, customers who spent $250 on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are forced to sit around and twiddle their thumbs for at least a month. The standard [Galaxy Buds 3](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile-audio%2Fgalaxy-buds3%2F), which do not have rubber eartips, have not been delayed.
