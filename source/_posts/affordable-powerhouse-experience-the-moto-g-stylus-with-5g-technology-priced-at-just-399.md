## Affordable Powerhouse: Experience the Moto G Stylus with 5G Technology, Priced at Just $399

Motorola's mid-range Moto G Stylus 5G is back for 2024 with substantial upgrades and a fun new design. It sports a better screen, wireless charging, and more for only $399.

 Similar to the previous generation, this phone is big, thanks to an upgraded 6.7-inch pOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. While it has the same Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip inside as last year, now it'll come with 8GB of RAM, up from the outgoing model's 4-6GB offering. It also retains the old-fashioned 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD slot for storage expansion, and USB-C.

 More importantly, the new 2024 Moto G Stylus now offers 15W wireless charging for its large 5,000 mAh battery and 30W TurboPower fast wired charging for all-day power. Other specs include a primary 50MP OIS camera on the rear paired with a 13MP ultrawide lens. Then, for selfies, you're looking at a 32MP front camera.

Motorola

 Of course, it wouldn't be an upgrade without improvements to the built-in stylus. With the 2024 model, Motorola's press release claims the company upgraded the contact area, making for a more precise user experience. Then, the stylus should work better than ever, thanks to several updates to the software and UI to improve performance and latency. Draw, jot down notes, and more, all with ease.

 Motorola's big phone received several upgrades over previous generations, and that's most apparent once you look at the design. It now comes in two fun colors with a soft-touch faux leather back. You can choose between red or brown, which Motorola calls Caramel Latte or Scarlet Wave. Thankfully, it'll run Android 14 out of the box, but it'll only get one major update to Android 15\. Then, owners will receive three years of software and maintenance upgrades.

 If the affordable [Moto G Play announced earlier this year](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-innovation-insights-into-vr-gear-designs/) told us anything, Motorola wanted to step things up in 2024\. So far, we see exactly that with the wood-backed Moto Edge 50 Ultra Pro and now this powerful vegan leather Moto G Stylus 5G. Grab yours in one of two colors for only $399 starting May 30th from Walmart, Amazon, and Motorola.

 The new Moto G Stylus will arrive in the coming weeks at Metro by T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket, Boost Infinite, Boost Mobile, UScellular, Spectrum, Google Fi Wireless, Straight Talk, Visible, and other carriers.
