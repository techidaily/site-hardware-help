AiDot

[Embracing the AiDot Matter protocol](https://www.aidot.com/matter?utm%5Fsource=PR&utm%5Fmedium=AiDotMatterPage&utm%5Fcampaign=Howtogeek) from the outset, AiDot has emerged as a trailblazer in the adoption of this smart home standard. With the Matter protocol, consumers no longer need to worry about the compatibility of their devices and appliances.

 They also no longer need to stick with a proprietary hub. The Matter protocol allows smart home products to communicate effectively and work seamlessly together. These innovations make it an industry-unifying protocol for smart home devices and a game changer for consumers.

 AiDot has a longstanding collaboration with the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) and even received the Matter Outstanding Certification Award in 2023\. It is playing a significant role in the development, maintenance, and promotion of open global standards for the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. In other words, it is actively involved in the shaping of how IoT devices interact on a global scale.

 This endorsement clearly shows that AiDot is not only about self-promotion. It also has a solid commitment to advancing the IoT industry as a whole rather than focusing solely on its own products and services.

> AiDot leads with innovation and fully embraces the Matter smart home standard. They're shaping the future of smart homes with cutting-edge devices, and we’re excited to see their new developments. AiDot continues to redefine connected living and driving progress as a valued member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance.

##  The WELOV P200 Pro: Design and Features

![linkind smart plug with welove air purifier in the background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/linkind-smart-plug-out-of-box-2100x1400.jpg)

 The [WELOV P200 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/WELOV-Purifiers-Coverage-P200-Pro/dp/B0CQ1XWXLN?maas=maas%5Fadg%5F0C608AA5B28E926CE5C9D91B50E4AFEE%5Fafap%5Fabs&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&tag=maas) is the world’s first Matter-certified air purifier. With the release of Matter 1.2, you can integrate the P200 Pro with other Matter-certified devices, including light bulbs, switches, and plugs, into your existing smart home ecosystem.

 Not only that, but 1.2 allows you to use the air purifier across major voice-assistant platforms, including Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Nest, without the need for separate hubs or apps.

 The compatibility update for Matter 1.2 will roll out in stages. SmartThings expects to have complete Matter 1.2 functionality by early June, while Apple HomeKit, Google Nest, and Alexa will follow after June. Please refer to official announcements for precise completion times.

###  Precise Air Insights and External Environment Monitoring

 Intelligent air monitoring actively scans outdoor conditions and adjusts its settings based on the pollutants present to optimize your air quality indoors. These pollutants include pollen, smoke, and pollution.

 Furthermore, the machine uses infrared sensors to detect indoor pollution levels. It easily detects PM2.5, which are tiny particles or droplets 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter. These particles are particularly harmful and come from various sources, such as vehicle exhausts, industrial emissions, and construction sites.

 These innovative monitoring features ensure you and your family can breathe easy, no matter what is happening on the outside, be it high pollen, peak-time traffic, or any other polluting nuisance.

###  Different Modes for Different Scenarios

Close 

 You can use the WELOV P200 Pro in Auto or Manual Mode. With Auto Mode, which you can set to ‘default’ for convenience, the appliance detects particle and PM2.5 levels, excluding the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or gases, such as methane. In this mode, there are also ‘quiet’ and ‘efficient’ options to utilize depending on your needs.

 In Manual Mode, you can set the appliance to low, medium, or high settings, and then there is also the all-important Sleep Mode.

###  Sleep Mode and Apple Health Integration

 People commonly use air purifiers during the night when sleeping. This practice is an excellent idea for those who suffer from allergies. But parents may also look to create optimal sleeping conditions for youngsters, while the elderly greatly benefit from a sound night’s sleep. It’s vital to have clean air while sleeping, and if you live in a big city or an area prone to wildfires, you’ll know all about this.

 Research by Brigham and Women’s Hospital reveals that the majority of people fall short of the recommended seven hours of sleep every night. The hospital’s research was based on sleep patterns of Apple Watch users with data recorded from almost three million sleeps.

 This research is why AiDot has focused primarily on developing its innovative Sleep Mode on the WELOV P200 Pro air purifier. You can adjust Sleep Mode settings to suit your personal needs and sleep patterns by syncing your data from Apple Health.

 In Sleep Mode, the P200 Pro also runs very quietly. In fact, it operates at just 23dB, which sits snugly somewhere between a whisper and regular breathing. In other words, you can barely hear it. Not only that, but the night light is adjustable, and you can use it to create some nighttime ambience or turn it off completely.
