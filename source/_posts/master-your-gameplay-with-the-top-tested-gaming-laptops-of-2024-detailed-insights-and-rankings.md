## Stay Productive for Days with the Latest Addition to Lenovo Laptops - The Powerful ThinkPad T14s Featuring Snapdragon X Elite CPU & Massive 32GB RAM

Lenovo has started to roll out its business-focused[ThinkPad T14s](https://weibo.com/u/1617785922) Gen 6 laptop, with promotional materials claiming the thin and light portable can deliver up to 29 hours of battery life. Of course, this is one of the new breed of[Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite](https://tools.techidaily.com) \-powered devices running[Windows 11](https://tools.techidaily.com) , but that headline battery stamina claim is still extraordinary. Marketing claims and reality don’t always go hand-in-hand, so a little skepticism about this device’s advertised battery run time might be wise until it has been independently reviewed.

 Keeping our focus on the battery life of the new ThinkPad T14s for now, Lenovo’s 29-hour measurement is said to have been taken from a (local) video playback test. Such a use case might be valid for frequent travelers on long flights without access to power outlets who prefer to pack their offline entertainment. The built-in battery capacity of 58Wh is nothing unusual for a thin and light, even one that is just 1.24kg in weight and 16.9mm thick, like this Lenovo.

 The beating heart of the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s is a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor with 12 Oryon CPU cores built upon the Arm architecture. Other early details reveal that Lenovo has a dual-fan cooling system here. While we expect one to concentrate its cooling efforts on the Snapdragon, it would be interesting to know what, if any, additional heat center inspired the extra fan.

 This ThinkPad T14s is built for business, so it comes with a better selection of ports than many consumer laptops. Users should also expect something more hard-wearing than an affordable consumer portable.

 Of course, there is a cost for the pro-spec and build quality. At the China eCommerce outlets, where this model popped up first, pricing starts at roughly the equivalent of $1,700 for the spec shown in the table above.
