## Get Your Thrustmaster T300 Driving Experience: Installers for Windows 10 & 11 Available Now

Without the T300 drivers installed, there’s a strong chance your racing games won’t see the wheel at all. Therefore, when you’ve got a problem with your Thrustmaster T300 racing wheel, you may need to think about updating the drivers.

## Why do you need to update the T300 drivers?

 Driver functions as a translator between your device and operating system. Your operating system and your device don’t actually speak the same language. When your operating system gives a command to your device, your device can not understand it. Therefore, your operating system and your device need a translator. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices but drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

This is why most of the problems can be solved by updating drivers.

### Method 2: Update the driver automatically

 If you don’t have time or computer skills to manually update your drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. In other words, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
