## Compact and Cute: Discover the Charming SwitchBot K10+ Pro Miniature RoboVac

The world's smallest robotic vacuum just got an upgrade. SwitchBot is now offering the K10+ Pro, a mini robovac that can slip under furniture, sidle up against walls, and navigate through chair legs without getting itself stuck.

 We were smitten by the [original K10+ vacuum](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-iphone-14-plus-backup-password-never-set-but-still-asking-heres-the-fix-drfone-by-drfone-ios/). Sure, it wasn't as powerful as a full-sized robovac, but it did a great job keeping rooms tidy while taking up very little space. The charging station's built-in dust bin was a great convenience, and because the vacuum was so quiet, we rarely found ourselves jumping up to turn it off.

 In many ways, the [SwitchBot K10+ Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7W3N7H6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004832&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fswitchbot-k10-plus-pro-launch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is just a rehash of its predecessor. It retains the dimensions of the original K10+ vacuum—9.76 inches wide and 3.62 inches tall—and its charging station can hold four liters of dust, dirt, hair, or whatever else gets picked up during cleaning. The vacuum's 150-minute battery is also carried over from the original model, as is its 45dB quiet-cleaning mode.

 Still, there are some notable improvements in this upgraded model. The K10+ Pro boasts a 3,000Pa maximum suction, up from 2,6000Pa. It adds a new PSD sensor to the original LiDAR array for more effective room mapping and obstacle avoidance, and its brush has been retooled to prevent hair tangling.

 While the improved suction is definitely a selling point, the K10+ Pro's new PSD sensor is arguably a bigger addition. It should help the vacuum twist and spin around furniture legs, wall edges, and other tight spots that are hard to "see" with a standard LiDAR array.

 And, given that this is a SwitchBot device, the K10+ Pro boasts smart home integration with support for the next-gen Matter standard. You can control the vacuum with voice commands or through the smart home app, program its weekly cleaning schedule, or build it into smart home automations.

 While the K10+ is a useful and unique product, some retailers may incorrectly market it as a vacuum _and_ a mop. This was one of our only complaints in our [original K10+ review](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-iphone-14-plus-backup-password-never-set-but-still-asking-heres-the-fix-drfone-by-drfone-ios/); the "mop" function, if you can call it that, is just a plastic bracket that can hold a Wet Wipe. There's no mop head or water tank—_the K10+ Pro is not a mop_. SwitchBot is downplaying this mop stuff in its K10+ Pro product listings, which I appreciate, though I don't trust third-party retailers to do the same.

 The SwitchBot Mini K10+ Pro is now available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7W3N7H6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004832&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fswitchbot-k10-plus-pro-launch%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and the [SwitchBot web store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004832/https://www.switch-bot.com/pages/switchbot-mini-robot-vacuum-k10-pro). Early customers can snag the vacuum for $420, although the MSRP is $600.
