 If you have a Samsung 850 EVO SSD, you should read this post to help your device get a better performance.

 Many of you just plug SSD into your PC, use it and then roll out, but there’s a driver you should install and help it boost stably.

## Why you need Samsung 850 EVO driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

## How to download the Samsung 850 EVO driver?

Usually, there are two ways you can get the right drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

 Once you’ve downloaded the utility, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### **Option 2 – Automatically updat** e drive**rs**
