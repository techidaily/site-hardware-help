## Get Your Microsoft Wireless Mouse ([[5000]) Up and Running with Simple Driver Download Instructions

If you have a Microsoft wireless mouse or just bought it but found it didn’t function properly, you may need to update the driver to fix it. Don’t worry, this post is going to show you how to update driver and set up as you want.

## Why you need Microsoft wireless mouse 5000 drivers?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.
