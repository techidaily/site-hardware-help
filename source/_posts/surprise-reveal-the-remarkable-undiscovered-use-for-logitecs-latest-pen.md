## Surprise Reveal: The Remarkable, Undiscovered Use for Logitec's Latest Pen!

Logitech now offers a dedicated Meta Quest stylus called the MX Ink. Priced at $130, the MX Ink promises to help users "create, annotate, and navigate" 3D or 2D elements in virtual reality.

 Technically speaking, you can already use the Meta Quest controllers to draw in apps like Gravity Sketch, PaintingVR, Adobe Substance Modeler, or VRChat. The MX Ink simply aims to make VR-based 3D modeling and 2D design more comfortable and intuitive. Instead of fussing with a couple of bulky controllers, you can use a stylus that's roughly the size of an Apple Pencil (albeit twice as thick) and equipped with a pressure-sensitive tip, plus haptic feedback.

 The MX Ink pairs through the Meta Quest app. Upon first pairing the device, the user is sent through a "NUX" (or "New User Experience") guide that explains the stylus' functionality. A dedicated customization page for the stylus, where you can alter pressure curves and other settings, is tucked within the primary Meta Settings menu.

 And, interestingly, you can connect MX Ink to your headset without disconnecting your standard Meta Quest controllers. Logitech claims that MX Ink is the first Meta Quest controller with this capability.

 Naturally, the MX Ink has a big button that lets you grab and interact with elements in VR. Double-tapping this button mimics the "B" button of a Meta Quest controller. It even offers 6DoF spacial tracking, just like Meta's controllers. You shouldn't _need_ to switch over to your standard controllers too often, though I assume that some users will employ a hybrid approach, taking an MX Ink in one hand and a Meta Quest controller in the other.

 Note that this is the second-ever Logitech accessory for Meta Quest. The first was a wacky set of [off-ear speakers](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/vr/chorus-for-meta-quest-2.982-000153.html) that attached to the sides of the Meta Quest headset.

 I reached out to Logitech to ask about headset compatibility. The company said that MX Ink will work with the [Quest 3](https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-securing-the-title-top-5-hmds-for-drone-pilots-for-2024/), the [ultra-affordable Quest 2](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/unlock-the-secrets-to-restoring-erased-chats-on-any-cellular-device/), and "future headsets." I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that the upcoming [Quest 3S](https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-quest-3s-everything-we-know/) works with MX Ink. However, the oft-maligned [Quest Pro](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/nalyzing-the-post-upload-process-in-youtubes-ecosystem-for-2024/) is not supported. Quest Pro's controllers come with a set of "drawing nibs," so this isn't the worst omission in the world, although I believe that Quest Pro owners should take this as a warning sign—Meta's flagship headset is not considered a priority.

 The [MX Ink](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards.html) will sell for $130 when it launches at the Meta Connect 2024 event on September 25th or 26th. A bundled version that includes an MX Inkwell charging dock costs $170\. Logitech will also offer a textured drawing surface for 2D art, called the MX Mat, for $50.
