 Voicemails can contain very personal messages, and you may want to keep them around long past the lifespan of your phone. Thankfully, it's very easy to save a voicemail on your Android phone, whether it's a Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy.

 Like a lot of things in the Android world, the [way voicemail works](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-beginners-obs-techniques-for-youtube-live-streaming/) on your particular phone may be unique to that phone. However, we'll walk you through the process of using Samsung's Visual Voicemail app and [Google's Phone app](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/understanding-why-files-carry-an-x-marking/), which should cover most people. The steps are likely very similar for other Android devices as well. Let's get started.

##  Save Voicemails on Samsung Galaxy Phones

 First, open the full app list on your Samsung Galaxy phone and launch "Visual Voicemail."

![Open "Visual Voicemail."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230906_165325_nova-launcher.jpg)

 Select the voicemail you'd like to save. You may need to let it load and tap it a second time to expand the voicemail.

![Select a voicemail.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230906_165355_visual-voicemail.jpg) 

 With the voicemail expanded, tap the "i" info button.

![Tap the info button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230906_165359_visual-voicemail.jpg) 

 Now tap the three-dot menu icon in the top right and select "Archive." You wouldn't be alone in thinking this will delete the voicemail, but that's not what will happen.

 You'll see a pop up that says the voicemail will be saved to the phone's storage and deleted from the voicemail server. Tap "Archive."

 That's it! You can find the voicemail in the file manager app under Internal Storage > VisualVoiceMail.

##  Save Voicemails on Google Pixel Phones

 First, open the [Google Phone app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2000243/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer) and go to the "Voicemail" tab.

 Select a voicemail to expand it, then tap the share icon.

![Open a voicemail and tap the share button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230906-145352.png) 

 Now, you will have to select an app to share the voicemail to. So, if you just want to save the MP3 file, your best option is to choose a cloud storage app, such as Google Drive.

![Share to an app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot_20230906-145359.png) 

 The voicemail file can now be accessed from the app, and you're free to do whatever you want with it. Google's method is a lot easier than Samsung's, but both work. You can also try a [third-party voicemail app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2000243/https://play.google.com/store/search?q=voicemail&c=apps) for even more options.
