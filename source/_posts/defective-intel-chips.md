## Navigate the World of Gadgets: Find Reliable Tips and Specs Today

AMD has listed the new Ryzen 5 9600X for pre-order on its[Canadian Amazon store](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftarget.georiot.com%2FProxy.ashx%3Ftsid%3D45723%26GR%255FURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Famazon.ca%252Fdp%252FB0D6NN6TM7%253Ftag%253Dhawk-future-ca-20%2526ascsubtag%253Dtomshardware-us-8983708545272344516-20) . Officially releasing with the rest of the Ryzen 9000-series on July 31st, the 9600X currently shows up at $472.45 CAD.  
  
 Determining the analogous U.S. price requires a bit of guesswork. The $472 CAD price at current exchange rates is equivalent to $345 USD, though our generous napkin math, accounting for taxes and the inflated rates Canadians pay for computer components (we're sorry, Canada), brings the potential price closer to $300 USD.  
  
 Alternatively, today the[Ryzen 5 7600X costs $275 CAD](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftarget.georiot.com%2FProxy.ashx%3Ftsid%3D45723%26GR%255FURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Famazon.ca%252FAMD-7600X-12-Thread-Unlocked-Processor%252Fdp%252FB0BBJDS62N%253Ftag%253Dhawk-future-ca-20%2526ascsubtag%253Dtomshardware-us-6673320314666460086-20) vs the 'local' (for us)[Amazon price of $185 USD](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FAMD-7600X-12-Thread-Unlocked-Processor%2Fdp%2FB0BBJDS62N%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomshardware-us-1010452049108629975-20) , a 1.486X scaling factor. If this same factor is applied to 9600X, the US price falls at $318, squarely between the exact exchange conversion and our napkin math. That feels a lot more plausible but still doesn't give a warm and fuzzy feeling.  
  
 Working from an estimated $319 USD price tag gives us serious questions about the Ryzen 5 9600X. Last-gen's Ryzen 5 7600X also launched at a $299 price point. That price was the 7600X's greatest negative, and today the same chip sits at an official MSRP of $229 and can be had for $185 via[Prime Day deals](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech) . If the 9600X launches even higher than that at $319, it will be a hard sell for consumers and will likely need to fall to the mid-$200s before long. We hope the current Canadian price is simply inflated to take advantage of pre-order buyers; otherwise, it may become the 9600X's Achilles' heel.  
  
 Traditionally, AMD's Ryzen 5 chips are incredibly attractive for mainstream gamers and PC enthusiasts, offering a great bang for the buck once online prices settle down. AMD's Ryzen 5 9600X is a six-core, 12-thread chip based on the[Zen 5 architecture](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-deep-dives-zen-5-ryzen-9000-and-strix-point-cpu-rdna-35-gpu-and-xdna-2-architectures) . Base clocks for the chip are 3.9 GHz, with boosts up to 5.4 GHz. This power will come with a TDP of 65W and a peak power draw of only 88W. A 38MB (6+32) cache and support for up to DDR5-5600 memory round out the spec sheet.  
  
 AMD showed the Ryzen 5 9600X crushing Intel's Core i5-14600K by 22% in productivity[benchmarks](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark) and 11% in gaming at its Zen 5 Tech Day, with an 88W peak power draw versus Intel's 181W. A lead of this margin for almost half of the power shows strong performance for the bottom of AMD's Zen 5 desktop CPU slate, though as always we need to take manufacturer benchmarks with a spoonful of salt. If AMD prices Ryzen 5 9600X below $300 (which we suspect it will, eventually), it becomes a shoo-in for[our best value CPU](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html#section-value-best-cpu-for-gaming-200-to-250) , a spot currently held by the Ryzen 5 7600X.
