The one thing that would sweeten the deal though is if the extra software was Mac-friendly.

##  Design: Digging the Look and Controls

 I haven’t had the privilege of testing JBL’s other Quantum Stream mics, but one of our other reviewers gave the [standard Stream](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-zoom-essentials-for-webinar-novices-an-introductory-walkthrough/) pretty high marks.

 If I were only judging a book by its cover, the Quantum Stream Studio would have won me over on looks alone. The mic’s adjustable housing and desk stand are one and the same. Placed on a table, the Studio is roughly 8 inches tall. Should you ever want to use a boom arm, all you have to do is unscrew the bottom of the stand to reveal the threaded mounting adapter.

 I love the Studio’s metallic black appearance, a cosmetic trait shared by all of JBL’s Quantum lineup. An RGB light ring encircles the top of the Studio, and another RGB ring is built into the on-mic volume knob. It was nice to get a quick idea of how loud or soft things are with this simple LED indicator. I even loved the convenient mute switch at the top of the Studio. Just tap the mic icon once to mute and again to unmute.

 As a quad pattern-mic, the Studio has four distinct pickup patterns to choose from. Set to cardioid by default, you can toggle between the three other presets (omnidirectional, stereo, and bidirectional) by pressing the “P” button on the bottom of the mic. Oh, and that volume knob has a couple of tricks up its sleeve. Press it once to toggle between headphone audio (represented by blue RGB lighting) and again to adjust microphone gain (represented by purple).

 On the back of the mic is where you’ll find its USB-C port and 3.5mm audio adapter. A nylon-braided USB-C to USB-A cable is included, but you’ll need to provide your own USB adapters (and we have [a list of some great ones](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-joint-venture-campaigns-for-brands-on-video-platforms/)) if your PC or Mac doesn’t have USB-A ports.

##  Features: Engineered to Deliver Pro Sound

![The JBL Quantum Stream Studio sitting on a table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/the-jbl-quantum-stream-studio-sitting-on-a-table_53573442764_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 One of my favorite things about the Quantum Stream Studio is that it delivered enough features and settings to make me feel like I was getting a personalized audio experience, even if some of these capabilities were only active behind the scenes. The Studio’s dynamic range compressor is probably the best example. When recording, if you’re too loud, the compressor will automatically lower levels to avoid clipping. When you’re too quiet, it adds a bit more gain.

 Premium engineering was a big staple, too. The Studio is equipped with three 14mm cardioid condenser mics. Each mic handles a frequency range of 50Hz to 16kHz. Sample rates top out at 192kHz, and bit-depth is maxed at 24 bits.

 A 3.5mm port may not seem like a huge deal, but having the ability to monitor mic and headphone levels, _without_ relying on an interface, was a huge pro for me. This is especially convenient for Twitch-streaming gamers who need to adjust how much audio is routed through a headset.

##  Mic Quality: Solid from the Start

![The mic volume control on the JBL Quantum Stream Studio](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/the-mic-volume-control-on-the-jbl-quantum-stream-studio_53573442759_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 To test the Quantum Stream Studio, I connected the mic to my late 2020 MacBook Pro’s Thunderbolt 4 port, and performed all record-capture tests in GarageBand.

 I wanted to test each of the four pickup patterns, so I started with cardioid mode (the out-of-the-box default). This pickup setting puts all the attention on the front-center of the mic, with the sides and rear receiving less attention. I thought the recorded audio was crisp, clear, and packed with a surprising amount of low-end. Switching to omnidirectional opened the soundstage up a bit. This setting is best used when more than one person is chatting in the same room. I noticed a little more compression in the recorded audio with this preset.

 The bidirectional pattern is meant for one-on-one conversations in which the interviewee sits on the other side of the mic. I thought the Studio did a nice job at isolating capture-points to the front and back sections of the mic. Last but not least is stereo mode. Meant to be used when recording instruments, or chit-chatting with a guest while you’re both in front of the mic, I actually didn’t think this preset sounded much different than the cardioid mode.

 One thing you’re going to have to contend with is vibrations here and there. Even as I typed this review, my laptop keys sounded pretty intense through the headphones connected to the Studio. You’ll also get a lot of low-end rumbles if you accidentally hit the mic or its stand. While I don’t think these are _true_ drawbacks (it’s a testament to how sensitive the mic is!), it’s something I felt readers should be aware of.

##  Software: No Luck for Apple Fans

 Every JBL Quantum microphone comes with JBL’s free-to-use QuantumENGINE PC software. A Windows-only application, QuantumENGINE gives users an intuitive dashboard of settings that can be applied to the Quantum Stream Studio. Some noteworthy UI adjustments are a multi-band EQ, a noise reduction filter, and various RGB lighting customizations. You can also use the software to download updates to the Studio.

 Unfortunately, mine is a Mac-only household, so I wasn’t able to test the companion software. That being said, I did mess around with my GarageBand EQ. Doing so allowed me to hone in on specific frequency ranges, giving me an even better idea of the highs and lows the Studio can handle.

##  Should You Buy the JBL Quantum Stream Studio?

 The [JBL Quantum Stream Studio](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Quantum-Stream-Studio-Microphone/dp/B0CTBGMNMB/ref=asc%5Fdf%5FB0CTBGMNMB/?tag=hotoge-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=695630883489&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3428893240204997072&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9004840&hvtargid=pla-2298633700977&mcid=141c17a3aada3784947201acc9e96caa&gad%5Fsource=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwltKxBhDMARIsAG8KnqUiGM%5FgdrVMF5Z142IE6xcYhYmyzRYgnPjX4URrP4s8kJUrOn0sj1UaAtiZEALw%5FwcB&th=1&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002977&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fjbl-quantum-stream-studio-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) doesn’t mess around, folks. It may not be the fanciest or most expensive USB mic on the market, but it’s the kind of audio peripheral that both newcomers and seasoned recording vets will be pleased with. All the most integral controls are located right on the mic body, and not having to rely on an audio interface is a true godsend.

 While macOS users may want to look elsewhere, I personally wouldn’t mind using the Studio as a mic for my MacBook setup.
