## To update your NVIDIA Quadro graphics card driver

There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:

**Download and install your Quadro driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the **[NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/)**  , and searching for the latest driver for your device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your graphics card, and your version of Windows.

or

**Download and install your Quadro driver automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Quadro driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
