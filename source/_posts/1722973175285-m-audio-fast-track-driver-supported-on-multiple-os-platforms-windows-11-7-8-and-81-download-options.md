## Option 2 – Download and install the driver manually

 M-Audio updates and releases the fast track USB driver on their website.To get the correct fast track driver, you need to go to the[M-Audio website](http://m-audio.com/support/drivers) **,** find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 The downloaded driver file could be a**zip** file or an**exe** file. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, verify the file format. If the file is in exe format, just double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
