##  What to Look for in an Amazon Fire TV in 2024

 Amazon's Fire TV platform is most commonly found on streaming devices, but a growing number of value-for-money televisions also use it. It puts content front and center, and Alexa's deep integration is helpful if you use voice controls to find TV shows and movies.

 Selecting a Fire TV model is the same as picking up any other TV. You want the television to run on the Fire TV platform, satisfy your TV needs, and provide a great viewing experience.

 One of the most important things to consider while choosing a new Fire TV is its size. For the best experience, you should pick a size based on how far you'll be sitting from it. We have a [nifty guide for quickly determining the right TV size](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-counter-image-navigation-in-digital-age-a-facebook-guide/) so you can easily get that factor squared away.

 TV resolution is also essential, but 4K is a no-brainer nowadays. [4K TVs](https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/jaycut-for-beginners-learn-how-to-edit-videos-online-for-free/) are more affordable than ever, and you'll have no problem finding high-resolution content. Even if you watch a lot of cable, DVDs, or broadcast TV, your Fire TV will upscale it for a good experience.

 If you play games a lot, it's a good idea to pick a TV with low input lag, faster response time, and features like [Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM)](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/). These features will make sure gaming doesn't feel like a chore on your television. Similarly, you want [good HDR support](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/), better image processing, and excellent picture quality while buying a TV for movies.

 These are just some things you want to consider while picking up a new TV. We recommend going through our [complete guide on buying a new TV](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/master-the-remastered-yakuza-3-for-pc-with-these-essential-stability-fixes/) to make sure you have all of your bases covered.

 The [Fire TV Omni QLED](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), the newest member of Amazon's Fire TV portfolio, is the company's most powerful and feature-rich TV to date and the best Fire TV you can buy. It delivers excellent picture quality, thanks to the inclusion of some advanced technologies that are missing in Amazon's other televisions.

 As the TV's name suggests, one of these technologies is [quantum dots](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-poco-x6-pin-codepattern-lockpassword-by-drfone-android/). These nanocrystals significantly improve the color gamut of the LCD screen, resulting in vibrant and lifelike colors in HDR content. Amazon has also added [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/) to improve the contrast and the black levels. Plus, you get support for all popular HDR formats, including [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/).

 In other highlights, while the Fire TV Omni QLED's design isn't particularly striking, it looks decent and has a good build quality. The TV also enjoys deep integration of [Alexa voice assistant](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-gaming-on-tv-obs-guide/), allowing you to control your TV using voice or issue commands to connected smart home products. Moreover, you don't need your remote to talk to the TV as it supports a hands-free Alexa experience.

 Gamers will appreciate the addition of [variable refresh rate technology](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) and the TV's low input lag, but the TV's [refresh rate](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-guide-sharing-igtv-in-the-world-of-insta-stories/) tops out at 60Hz, and there are no [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) ports. Instead, you get four HDMI 2.0 ports, one of which doubles as an [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) port to pass high-quality, uncompressed audio data to a connected soundbar or receiver.

 Although there is much to like about the Fire TV Omni QLED, it has some issues and missing features. For example, the TV has poor viewing angles, so the colors will seem washed out if you watch it from an angle and not head-on. It also [struggles to upscale 480p and 720p content](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/amazon/fire-tv-omni-qled-series#test%5F112), which can be a problem if the source passing this content to the TV doesn't include its own [upscaling](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/).

 Finally, there is no [ATSC 3.0](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/ai-writing-unmasked-5-must-have-detectors-for-academic-and-corporate-leaders/) to enjoy 4K over-the-air broadcasts; you can only buy it in [65-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) and [75-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) sizes. If you need a smaller TV, [Hisense's U6HF](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WNJT9X3?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) is a good alternative, including quantum dot technology, local dimming, and VRR support.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| ✓ Support for hands-free Alexa                  | ✗ Doesn't get bright enough for great HDR experience |
| ✓ Dolby Vision support in 65 and 75-inch models | ✗ No next-gen gaming features                        |

 The [Fire TV Omni](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=htgprimedaysite-20), which sits below the Fire TV Omni QLED in Amazon's Fire TV lineup, is perfect if you don't want to spend over $500\. It packs several features that you won't find on any other Fire TV in this budget, including support for hands-free Alexa.

 While other Fire TVs talk to Alexa using their remote control, the Fire TV Omni features a far-field microphone array that enables [Alexa](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/overcoming-audio-issues-a-comprehensive-fix-guide-for-noise-problems-on-lenovo-machines/) voice control without the remote---even when the screen is off.

 Even besides that, there is a lot to like in the Fire TV Omni, from its aggressive pricing to support for HDR10 and [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/). Dolby Vision is also available but it's limited to just the 65-inch and 75-inch models, which cost over $500\. The TV also supports Zoom app for video calling, Apple AirPlay 2, and the ability to pair the TV with Echo speakers for a home theater experience.

 On the gaming front, the TV offers an incredibly low [input lag](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-record-hulu-on-all-platforms-winmacmobile/), good response time, and ALLM. So the casual gamers will get a good experience. However, you don't get any advanced gaming features.

 Moreover, the Fire TV Omni has only a passable picture quality. The [contrast ratio](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-ledger-unveiling-the-best-text-generation-apps/) is poor, and it doesn't get very bright for an excellent HDR performance. The TV also lacks [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/), which could have significantly improved black levels.

 While this won't be a big issue for most people, if picture quality is really important to you, we suggest you go for the [Fire TV Omni QLED](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). You can also pick from one of our [best TV](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/maximizing-zoom-top-strategies-for-chromebooks/) or [best budget TV](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/-tools-for-cutting-edge-video-title-and-tag-generation/) recommendations and pair it with an [Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max](https://www.amazon.com/www.amazon.com/dp/B08MQZXN1X?tag=htgprimedaysite-20).

Best Amazon Fire TV Under $500

#####  Amazon Fire TV Omni

$350 $480 Save $130 

Amazon has produced the best Fire TV on the market in its first attempt at making televisions. The Fire TV Omni offers an impressive range of features for its price.

[$350 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=htgprimedaysite-20)

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ✓ Great value for money | ✗ Narrow viewing angles           |
| ✓ Upscaling works well  | ✗ Underwhelming gaming experience |
| ✓ Good contrast ratio   |                                   |

 If you are looking for an inexpensive Fire TV, the 43-inch [Insignia F30](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMDJ8TK3?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) is an excellent option. The television looks decent and has a good build quality for the price. In addition, you get a 4K 60Hz panel with a reasonable contrast ratio, so movies and TV shows will look great in a dark room.

 In addition, the television is good at [upscaling lower-resolution content](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/), so if you have DVDs lying around or watch a lot of cable TV, everything will look good. The F30 also has decent brightness for its price and includes [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) support.

 In other features, there are three HDMI 2.0 ports onboard, out of which one supports [ARC](https://change-location.techidaily.com/which-pokemon-can-evolve-with-a-moon-stone-for-vivo-s18e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) for audio passthrough to your soundbar.

 Unfortunately, the TV has narrow viewing angles, and its average input lag makes it unsuitable for gaming enthusiasts. Also, as you can expect from a budget TV, no Dolby Vision or [HDR10+](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/) support is included. Still, for under $300, this cheap Fire TV is pretty great.

But as the TV frame rate can only vary between 48Hz and 60Hz, you may still experience occasional [screen tearing](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-preloaded-features-of-chatgpt-functions-and-implementation-tips/), but it's still much better than having no VRR. Plus, Hisense has included [ALLM](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/), so your TV will automatically switch to the [Game Mode](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-much-income-arises-from-each-snapshot-video-for-2024/) as you start playing any game on the connected console or PC.

 In other features, the U6HF's image quality is good, and the TV gets sufficiently bright to deliver a decent HDR experience. Upscaling is another area where the Hisense TV shines, as it has no issues upscaling any lower-resolution content.

 All in all, it's a pretty good Fire TV for gaming. But of course, there are much better gaming TVs on the market. However, none of those come pre-installed with the Fire TV operating system. That said, if advanced gaming features like 120Hz refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 support, are more important to you than the pre-installed Fire TV OS, it's better to pick one of our [best gaming TV picks](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-visionvoice-tips-for-perfectly-sized-insta-posts/) and use the [Fire TV Stick 4K](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVYZ1Y5?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) to get the Fire TV OS experience.

 If you're primarily buying a Fire TV to watch movies and TV shows, there is no better option than the [Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). It has everything to deliver an excellent movie-watching experience. For example, the TV offers great picture quality thanks to its impressive contrast ratio and quantum dot technology. The visuals pop on the TV screen, and there is very little blooming.

 You can also watch all HDR movies in their full glory, as the TV includes support for HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. Furthermore, as the TV is also compatible with [HDR10+ Adaptive](https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mirthful-content-extraction-report/) and [Dolby Vision IQ](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-10-hashtag-trackers-on-facebook-twitter-and-instagram-networks/), it will adjust the HDR visuals based on the ambient lighting to give you the best experience.

 Despite having a 60Hz screen, the Fire TV Omni QLED successfully removes [judder](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fixing-video-editing-software-failures-after-effects-stability-on-windows-11-and-10/) from any source. In addition, it has a wide [color gamut](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) and almost complete coverage of the [DCI-P3](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-video-popularity-12-key-strategies-unveiled/) color space used by most 4K Blu-rays.

 In other highlights, if you are already a part of the Amazon ecosystem and own Echo speakers, you can pair them with the TV to get better sound. There is also an eARC port if you want to connect a soundbar and enjoy [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) audio.

 Unfortunately, Amazon TV suffers from poor viewing angles, which could mar your movie marathons with family or friends. And it has trouble [upscaling 480p and 720p content](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/amazon/fire-tv-omni-qled-series#test%5F113). So if you don't want to deal with these issues, you'll have to go for a non-Fire TV model and get your Fire TV experience via a streaming device. [Sony A95K](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R95YP36?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) and [Hisense U8H](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5YZNZTZ?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) are excellent non-Fire TV alternatives, depending on whether you want an [OLED](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) or LED TV.

## FAQ

### Can I cast to an Amazon Fire TV?

 Although the Amazon Fire TV doesn't support Chromecast functionality, you can cast your phone screen using [Android's native mirroring feature](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-music-syncing-for-iphones-and-androids-in-fb/) or an app like [AirScreen](https://www.amazon.com/AirScreen-AirPlay-Google-Cast-Miracast/dp/B07CPZ698R) on your Fire TV for iPhones. But before you do that, you'll have to enable mirroring on your TV by going to **Home** \> **Mirroring**.

### How do I reset an Amazon Fire TV?

 It's pretty easy to [reset your Amazon Fire TV](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-about-lock-screen-settings-on-your-infinix-gt-10-pro-by-drfone-android/). All you have to do is navigate to "Settings" and then choose "My Fire TV." You'll get the "Reset to Factory Defaults" option on the My Fire TV page. Remember, using this option will erase all your data from the Fire TV, including any apps or settings.

### How do you fix when an Amazon Fire TV is critically low on storage?

 Amazon Fire TVs typically come with 16GB of storage, out of which a few gigs are reserved for the operating system. So it's possible to encounter "low on storage" errors. You can fix these by [clearing the cache](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-screen-savvy-starting-point-deciphering-display-standards/) for various downloaded apps, [deleting apps](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/illustration-revolution-adding-depth-to-text-with-3d-for-2024/) that you don't use, and removing any [sideloaded files](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-from-filming-to-fame-discovering-the-top-10-ladies-on-youtube-for-2024/) that you no longer need. You can also reset your Fire TV to start fresh, but it's the nuclear option.
