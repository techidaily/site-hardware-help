![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb8235cdc55d.jpg)

 Trying to update the drivers for your **HP**   computer? You must be searching the Internet upside down for an easy and**safe** download.

But don’t worry, you’re safe in our hands!

## Pick the way you prefer

 There are two ways you can update the drivers for your**HP** PC in **Windows 10** , **8** or **7** :

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 **Option 1 – Download and install the drivers for your HP PC manually**

**WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [**Option 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Rest assured that the link below is the official website and 100% safe. So to manually update our HP drivers:

 First head to **[HP’s official website](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/home.html)** [](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us) and check out the section for driver downloads. Then enter the serial number of your **HP** PC and search for the specific drivers you’re to update.

 Be sure to choose **ONLY** drivers corresponding with your flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually (which could either be an **.inf** file or a **.zip** file).

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 **Option 2 – Download and install the drivers for your HP PC automatically (Recommended)**

 Manual updating all the drivers for a PC is no picnic. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the  drivers for your Dell laptop manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either[**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  or[**the Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:
