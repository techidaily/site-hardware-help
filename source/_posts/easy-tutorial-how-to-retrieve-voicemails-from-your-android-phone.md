Major carriers like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and US Cellular make it easy. Here's how to check your voicemail on Android.

##  How to Check Your Voicemail on an Android Phone

 The easiest way to check your voicemail inbox is by calling your voicemail using your own phone. Here's how to do so using various methods and carriers.

###  How to Call Your Voicemail on Any Carrier

 To call voicemail on Android, open the Phone app, and then press and hold down the **1** key. It may have a voicemail icon on it, but it should work even if you don't see that voicemail icon.

 While we've got instructions for popular US cellular carriers here with additional tips, this is the most important thing you need to know.

###  Listen to Your AT&T Voicemails

 If you're with AT&T, launch [your phone's Phone app](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-nokia-g42-5g-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/) and tap and hold **`1`**. This will dial your voicemail system. 

 Once you're connected, enter your voicemail password, and you'll hear your unheard voicemails. Saved voicemails can be accessed by pressing **1** on the keypad.

 Want to see your messages displayed on your screen instead? Use Visual Voicemail. You can download the official [AT&T Visual Voicemail](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU203774/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.mobile.android.vvm) app on your Android phone.

###  Access Your Verizon Voicemails

 If you're a Verizon subscriber, access your voicemails by launching the Phone app and dialing either **\*86** 

 or pressing and holding down **1**.

 When you're connected to the system, enter your voicemail password. You can now listen to your available voice messages.

 Optionally, you can access your Visual Voicemail using the Voicemail app in your phone's app drawer.

###  Hear Your T-Mobile Voicemails

 T-Mobile gives you two ways to access your voicemails.

 The first way is to open your Phone app and press and hold down **1** to connect to your voicemail system. Then, enter your password.

 The second way is to dial this voicemail number: **1-805-637-7249**. When you hear [the voicemail greeting](https://techidaily.com/how-to-update-apple-iphone-15-plus-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/), press the **\*** (asterisk) sign to interrupt it. Then, type your voicemail password.

![Dial own phone number and press *.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-10-03_10-04-25.jpg) 

 For Visual Voicemail, you'll need to use the [T-Mobile Visual Voicemail](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU203774/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmobile.vvm.application) app.

 For Visual Voicemail, you can download and use a free app like [Voxist](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU203774/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voxist.vm.android).
