## Easy Setup Steps for Your ScanSnap S51s Drivers – Latest Update

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50.png)

 Looking to update your**Scansnap S510 driver** but not sure where to get the latest download? If yes, then you’ve come to the right place. In this post, you’ll have two ways to download and install the driver efficiently.

## Why should I update the Scansnap S510 driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is an image scanner, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, if you ever encounter any problems relating to your scanner (e.g. the device stops working), try to update the corresponding driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble.

## How to update the Scansnap S510 driver

There are two ways you can update the driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-scansnap-s510-driver-quickly-easily/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Fujitsu keeps updating the scanner drivers. To get them, you need to go to the download website of **[Scansnap S510](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/support/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/software/s510.html)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64-bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
