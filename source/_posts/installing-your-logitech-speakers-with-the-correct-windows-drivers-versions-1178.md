![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_9-59-38-2.jpg)

 If you’re using a Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel on your PC, make sure you have the correct driver installed for it to function as it should.

 The Logitech G29 software runs on your operating system and enables it to communicate with the racing wheel you’re using.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your Logitech G29 Racing Wheel:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/logitech-g29-driver-download-for-windows-10-8-7/#a2)**
* **[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Option 1 – Automatically install the Logitech G29 driver

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
