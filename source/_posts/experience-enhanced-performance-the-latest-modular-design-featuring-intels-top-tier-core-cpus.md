## Experience Enhanced Performance: The Latest Modular Design Featuring Intel's Top-Tier Core CPUs

There are very few laptops out there more interesting than the Framework Laptop lineup. In a world where laptops are becoming increasingly less upgradeable/repairable, Framework is giving us laptops that go against this trend, where you can swap out and replace basically anything you want in a whim. Now, the laptops are gaining Intel Core Ultra processors, offering the best modularity with Intel's best laptop processors to date.

 Framework has unveiled a significant upgrade to its popular Laptop 13, featuring the latest [Intel Core Ultra](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/elevate-your-profiles-visual-appeal-for-2024/) Series 1 processors and a range of enhancements. As a fun fact, this new model is mentioned to carry "Series 1" chips, hinting that Intel might announce new "Series 2" Core Ultra chips eventually later this year. The new model boasts improved efficiency and battery life, particularly for video playback, and offers a substantial leap in gaming capabilities. In addition to this, you also get all of the new features that come as part of the new Core Ultra chips, such as the integrated NPU as well as the multi-level core configuration that plays a good part in the chip's capabilities to save battery.

 It's not the only improvement we're getting, though. Upgrade options now include an optional 2.8k display with a 120 Hz refresh rate, delivering amazing visuals as long as you're willing to pay more money. The display is available for both Intel and AMD configurations. Additionally, a new 9.2MP webcam with enhanced low-light performance and lower-noise microphones promise clearer video calls and recordings.

 Framework has expanded customization options with new colors for USB-C Expansion Cards and an English International keyboard layout with a "super" key for Linux users. The company also addresses the needs of businesses and professionals with new configurations that include a three-year warranty and Windows 11 Pro with Autopilot support.

 Existing Framework Laptop 13 owners can upgrade their devices with the new modules available in the Framework Marketplace. Pre-orders for the upgraded Laptop 13 are now open, with shipments expected to begin in August. The company has also permanently reduced prices for its AMD Ryzen 7040 Series configurations.
