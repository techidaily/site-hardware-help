## Unlock the Power of Affordable Excellence: Discover Why the Unattainable OnePlus Nord 4 Is Your Ideal Mid-Range Device

There used to be a time where the US was an important market for OnePlus, and while the company still maintains a US presence, not all of its products make it to the country. OnePlus just launched the Nord 4 smartphone, and even though it looks like a great device, it's not coming to the US.

 OnePlus has launched its latest mid-range smartphone, the Nord 4, at its Summer Launch Event in Milan alongside the new [OnePlus Tab 2](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-beginners-guide-to-windows-11-audible-recording/) (which is, for a change, available in the US). The Nord 4 features a 7.99mm aluminum body and a 6.74-inch 120Hz AMOLED display. And as far as internals go, the device is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chip, paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. We also have a huge 5,500mAh battery with 100W SUPERVOOC charging, promising a full charge in just 28 minutes.

OnePlus

 Like with the Tab 2, we have a bunch of AI features here, such as AI Speak, AI Summary, and AI Writer to enhance productivity. The camera system also gets an AI boost, with a 50-megapixel main sensor and AI-powered tools for photo enhancement. Lots of AI all around. OnePlus is also promising four major Android updates and six years of security updates for the Nord 4, the longest support window for any Nord device yet.

 OnePlus' Nord phones have been released in the US, but usually, it's just the really cheap or otherwise low-end ones instead of the "main" Nord entries like this one, which is sad because the specs on this can be really appealing to a lot of people shopping for mid-range phones in the US. The OnePlus Nord 4 starts at £429/€499 and comes in three colors. Pre-orders are open now if you happen to live in Europe.
