## Huge Savings Alert: Gigabyte's Aorus 49 OLED Gaming Screen Now at an All-Time Low - Only $969

A lot of gaming setups commonly include a dual or even triple monitor formation with a primary monitor for your game and support monitors for chat applications or maybe a YouTube guide video. The benefit of an ultrawide gaming monitor is that it's like having dual monitors seamlessly squished together for a panoramic viewing experience, but with fewer cables and less clutter (monitor arms and stands) on your desk.

 The Aorus CO49DQ from Gigabyte is a monster of a monitor with a massive ultrawide 49-inch QD-OLED panel and immersive 1800R curve. The specs of this premium screen are equally impressive with a GTG response time of 0.03ms, a fast 144Hz refresh rate, and even an included KVM switch.

 The Aorus CO49DQ has plenty of connection inputs with two HDMI 2.1 ports with CEC support, a DisplayPort 1.4 port, 1 x USB Type-C, and 2 x Type-A USB 3.2 pass-through ports. A headphone jack and two 5W speakers are also built into the chassis. The stand has swivel and tilt adjustment, but no height adjustment, but with 100 x 100 VESA mounting there's always the option to get a third-party arm or desk mount to provide additional adjustment options.

 See our[review of the Gigabyte Aorus CO49DQ](https://tools.techidaily.com) for more details. This monitor impressed us with its stunning image quality, contrast, and amazing build quality. Our only wish was that it would support higher than 144Hz refresh rates.
