## Logitech Keyboard Setup & Drivers Compatible with Windows 10 – Download Here

If you’d like to update drivers for your Logitech wireless keyboard, don’t worry. You can download and update the driver easily with one of the methods below.

1. [**Download and update the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Download and update the driver automaticall**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Method 1: Download and update the driver manually

 If you prefer to download drivers manually, you can download and update your Logitech wireless keyboard driver manually from Logitech official website:

 1) Go to[Logitech Download page](http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads)  .  
  
 2) Type your Logitech wireless keyboard model name in the search box and click the **More**  button for more content. (Let’s take K400 for example.)

 5) After the download completes, just double-click on the downloaded file (.exe) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.  

## Method 2: Download and update the driver automatically
