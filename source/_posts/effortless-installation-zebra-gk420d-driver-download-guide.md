### Way 3: Update Brother printer drivers with one-click via Driver Easy automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Brother printer driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact Brother printer, and your variant of Windows system version, and it will download and install it correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers, your Brother printer driver is no exception.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged video driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
