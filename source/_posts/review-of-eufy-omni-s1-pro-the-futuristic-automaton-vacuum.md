## Review of Eufy Omni S1 Pro: The Futuristic Automaton Vacuum

### Key Takeaways

* Eufy Omni S1 Pro is a top-tier robot vacuum with efficient cleaning and nimble handling.
* The roller brush technology ensures constant fresh water, enhancing cleaning performance.
* While not revolutionary, the S1 Pro is a solid option for those seeking a premium cleaning assistant.

 According to Eufy, the next generation of robot vacuums will look similar to the current crop. Although Eufy's new [Omni S1 Pro](https://www.eufy.com/robot-vacuum-s1-pro) vacuum and mop keeps a familiar design, I was still pleasantly surprised by its nimble handling, efficient cleaning, and sleek physical dimensions. More importantly, my wife was a fan as well.

#####  Eufy Omni S1 Pro

8/ 10 

One of the S1 Pro's highlight features is the floor-washing technology that removes dirty water from the roller mop in real time and replaces it with fresh water.

**Pros** 
* Great vacuuming and mopping performance
* Well-sized base station
* Nimble with good object avoidance

**Cons** 
* Occasionally missed some crumbs (but fewer than most robots)
* Nice looking water tank can show condensation for less attractive look

##  An Almost Next-Gen Vacuum and Mop

 If I didn’t suspect there would be a radical wave of change in the robot vacuum space in the next 12 to 18 months, I would say the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is the start of the next generation for this product category. Instead, since products like [Matic](https://maticrobots.com/product) are on their way, this new Eufy one looks more like the peak of the current robot vacuum technology.

 I’m on the tail end of testing all the new robot vacuums released this year. (Seriously, it's crazy how many robots have lived in my living room the last few months.) I’ve noticed that the specs keep improving and pieces keep extending, but the actual cleaning has only inched forward bit by bit.

 That’s true for the S1 Pro as well. It’s really good for a robot, but it’s more incrementally better than it is revolutionary over last year’s models. But if now is the time you want to buy an automated cleaning assistant, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better option than the S1 Pro.

 The vacuum with an integrated mop has a sophistication to it as it moves quickly and nimbly, always careful not to crash into chairs, walls, or other furniture pieces. The vacuum ditches the tall LiDAR housing that's common on premium models and hides it inside the plastic housing. Beyond a sleeker look, it also means the S1 Pro was able to fit in more areas around my house. I noticed the robot tended to move faster in uncluttered areas. I assume this is because its vision sees objects better than other robots.

 Underneath the unit is a long, single roller brush, instead of two oval pads. As the roller brush turns, it gets cleaned by fresh water inside the robot. When I specifically tested this by spreading visible baking power on the ground, I could see what it was doing. With less obvious messes and general day-to-day cleaning, I had a hard time visibly seeing it do its thing. The floors always _looked_ clean though.

 Another noticeable difference with the S1 Pro is its tall and narrow docking station. I didn't care for the look of it initially, in pictures, but in person, it's much more appealing. Its narrowness is surprisingly helpful to place it in more areas around the house. The company suggests that its taller design is easier to reach than short and wide base stations. Maybe that's true and a benefit, but that alone wouldn't make me spend money on it.

 I also like the clear water container in the front, though you can probably expect to see some condensation, so I probably wouldn't display the unit as a focal point. The water reservoirs were easy to remove and clean out of refill. Plus there's a secret compartment for a cleaning detergent to keep the dirty water from smelling.

##  Comparing the Eufy S1 Pro to the Eufy X10 Pro Omni

Eufy X10 Omni in its docking station

 I happen to be testing both the Omni S1 Pro and [X10 Omni](https://www.eufy.com/products/t2351111?variant=43078499532986), both from Eufy, at the same time. The X10 Omni is a much more traditional robot vacuum and mop, albeit still packed with plenty of features.

 Having both vacuums set up and functioning in the same spaces and on alternating days made it easy to compare the two. The biggest surprise was that the X10 Omni was no slouch compared to the fancier S1 Pro.

 The X10 Omni cleaned adequately, getting most crumbs and being able to maneuver to most areas. It wasn’t as quick or flexible as the S1 Pro, but it performed better than I expected. Its two spinning mop pads didn't seem to work as well, directly compared to the S1 Pro, but they did fine compared to robots from other companies.

 I found the X10 Omni’s base station one of the most disappointing parts of its whole experience. The gray plastic looked cheap and felt cheap. The water containers never leaked, but they didn’t seem like the sturdiest reservoirs I’ve ever tested. I wouldn’t love to leave the station anywhere it could be seen by guests. The S1 Pro's docking station not only looked better but it also has a screen to see information and perform basic commands. There's nothing like that on the X10 Omni.

 While I wouldn't go out of my way to pick the Eufy X10 Pro Omni over the S1 Pro, if it ends up on your list of considerations because of price or a specific need, I found it to work well. It does retail for $799 which is a respectable price and a decent value compared to other options in its class.

##  Should You Buy the Eufy S1 Pro?

![Eufy S1 Pro in its docking station-1](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/eufy-s1-pro-in-its-docking-station-1.jpg)

 Every robot vacuum I’ve tested has a big asterisk associated with it that hinges on the furniture and layout of your home. A complex floor plan will present a problem to nearly all autonomous vacuums. Still, I’ve been a big fan of the [Eufy Omni S1 Pro](https://www.eufy.com/robot-vacuum-s1-pro) and how it goes about its cleaning business.

 I liked its narrow and tall base station more than I expected to. I thought the robot’s sleek shape helped it nimbly navigate my house. But most importantly, both my wife and I were satisfied with the robot’s vacuuming and mopping performance. Not something that can be said of every robot that I've tested this year.

 Don’t expect complete perfection, but the S1 Pro is a worthy consideration if you’re looking to add a top-tier premium assistant to your home.
