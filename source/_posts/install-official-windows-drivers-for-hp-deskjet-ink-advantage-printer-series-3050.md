 Nothing is more frustrating than a non-working printer when you hurry to print a document. This is a common problem for many users and is likely related to the printer driver issues.

 Simply put, a driver is a software component that enables your device to communicate with the operating system. So, if the driver for HP DeskJet 2652 is outdated, incorrect, or corrupt, your printer may stop working and run into errors. In this post, we’ll introduce three ways to update HP DeskJet 2652 driver on Windows PC quickly and easily.

1. **[Update your driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Automatically update your HP DeskJet 2652 driver (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-hp-deskjet-2652-driver/#option2)**
3. **[Update your HP DeskJet 2652 driver using Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**1)** Go to **[HP support website](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers)**  . Select**Printer** to continue.

**4)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, there is an easier and quicker option.

## Option 2 – Automatically update your HP DeskJet 2652 driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee).

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the HP DeskJet 2600 series driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.jpg)

 You can do it for free it you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.
