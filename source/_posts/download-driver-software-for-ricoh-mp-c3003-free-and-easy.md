 If you find that your network connection is somehow glitchy, you need to update your Intel network card driver for it to work properly again. Here are two of the most effective ways to get your network card driver updated.

You just need to pick one of them to update your Intel card driver.

[**Method 1. Download from Intel Support**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[**Method 2. Download and Update Automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## **Method 1: Download from Intel Support Manually**
