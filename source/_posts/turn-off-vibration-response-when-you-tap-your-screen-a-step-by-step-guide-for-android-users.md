 When you tap certain items your phone will vibrate just a bit, giving you a little feedback. Sometimes this is nice, but maybe you don't like it. The good news is it's easy to disable on any Android device.

 Of course, this is Android we're talking about, so the process is going to [vary depending on your specific model](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-vivo-y200e-5g-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). That being said, you should be able to follow along loosely and find the necessary settings on your phone or tablet.

## How to Disable Haptic Feedback on a Google Pixel

 First, swipe down from the top of the screen twice to expand the Quick Settings, then tap the gear icon to open the Settings.

 From there, jump down to the "Sound & Vibration" option. Tap that.

![Tap &quot;Sound and Vibration.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2021-12-07_16-46-56.png) 

 Scroll down to "Vibration & Haptics." Note that this will be disabled if your phone is on silent mode, which also disabled haptics.

 Note that you can disable vibration for the Samsung Keyboard here, but if you use another keyboard, you'll have to do it from that app's settings.

 Your phone will now be vibration and haptic feedback-free. Haptic feedback is nice if your phone has a good vibration motor, [but it can be annoying](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-editscreen-pro-windows-8/) if it doesn't feel good.
