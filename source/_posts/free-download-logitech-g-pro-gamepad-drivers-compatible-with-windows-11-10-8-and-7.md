## Logitech Keyboard Setup & Drivers Compatible with Windows 10 – Download Here

If you’d like to update drivers for your Logitech wireless keyboard, don’t worry. You can download and update the driver easily with one of the methods below.

1. [**Download and update the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Download and update the driver automaticall**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Method 1: Download and update the driver manually

 If you prefer to download drivers manually, you can download and update your Logitech wireless keyboard driver manually from Logitech official website:

 1) Go to[Logitech Download page](http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads)  .  
  
 2) Type your Logitech wireless keyboard model name in the search box and click the **More**  button for more content. (Let’s take K400 for example.)

There might be several products listed in the screen. Click on your product name then you will be directed to the product page.

 5) After the download completes, just double-click on the downloaded file (.exe) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.  

## Method 2: Download and update the driver automatically

 To download driver from Logitech website, you need to identify the right driver from the software list. It could be waste of time. It is harder if you don’t know much about computer.
