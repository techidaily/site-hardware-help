##  What to Look for in a Laptop Accessory

 The size and fit are some of the first things to consider when buying laptop accessories. If you want a [laptop bag](https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/discover-the-best-4-free-online-calendar-solutions-today/), you'll have to make sure it has enough room to house your laptop, particularly if you have a large-screen device. Size remains an important consideration when shopping for lap desks and laptop stands.

 Your laptop's operating system also plays an important role. Some laptop accessories, like wired or wireless [mice](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/directly-send-snaps-from-your-phone-a-tutorial-for-2024/) and [keyboards](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-solidify-your-bio-link-an-easy-tiktok-methodology/), might only be compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux. While platform-specific accessories will provide the best experience with a particular OS, look for universal compatibility if you plan to use these accessories across multiple devices and platforms.

 Finally, there's connectivity. A USB hub is the best way to expand your laptop's capabilities with the addition of extra ports and various connectivity options. But ensure that you can easily connect the hub to your laptop. Most current laptops have additional USB-C ports for this purpose, while you might need a USB-A hub for older devices.

Timbuk2 

| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Can accommodate most 15 and 17-inch laptops | Expensive |
| Plenty of storage space                     |           |
| Air mesh back and padded shoulder straps    |           |
| Water-resistant                             |           |

 The [Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B32FCVY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000733&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-laptop-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a premium laptop backpack with a 28-liter capacity and a dedicated laptop storage compartment. This interior pocket can comfortably store most 15- to 17-inch laptops, with plenty of additional storage space for all your other devices. In addition to its large laptop compartment, it provides two main compartments and a small pocket to store smaller items. 

 Thanks to ultra-padded and supportive straps, the Authority Backpack is comfortable to carry around all day. It sports an Airmesh ventilated back panel that provides extra comfort for the wearer, and it features a water-resistant exterior and waterproof bottom to keep your devices well-protected against rain. 

 Despite its large capacity, the Timbuk2 Authority manages to be reasonably compact. It comes with a side storage pouch for a large water bottle and ample room for clothing or any extras you might need. It has a sturdy carry handle on the top, as well as a handy luggage pass-through for attaching to your suitcase's wheelie handle. 

 This amount of storage and durability comes at a premium, and there's no denying that the Authority backpack is an expensive option. However, if you're looking for a hard-wearing laptop backpack that will last for years, with storage space to spare, the Timbuk2 Authority is well-worth the investment.

A decent upgrade over the 2019 MX Master 3, the MX Master 3S comes with an 8,000 DPI sensor and a 90 percent quieter mouse click, making it one of the quietest mice available. You'll love it if you hate noisy and clicky mice.

 It features a sculpted design with a left thumb rest for your right hand and offers a very comfortable feel. You'll also get two scroll wheels for horizontal and vertical scrolling with ratcheting and free-spinning modes. The second wheel can be programmed to perform specific functions using Logitech's [Option Plus](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus.html) software. All in all, it offers a smooth, one-of-a-kind scrolling experience.

 You can connect the MX Master 3S to your laptop using the supplied USB-A dongle or via Bluetooth, and you can easily switch between devices. Another cool feature of the MX Master 3S is that it has a built-in battery that charges while you work. Moreover, this long-lasting battery can keep average users going for months.

| Pros                                                              | Cons            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 27,000mAh charger for your most demanding devices                 | Bulky and heavy |
| Fast charging support via 60W USB-C PD port                       |                 |
| Additional USB-C and USB-A ports for multiple device charging     |                 |
| 4-light LED indicators for battery percentage and charging status |                 |

 Even the best laptops will eventually run out of juice, and you're out of luck if you don't have access to a convenient charging point when on the go. That's where a [portable charger](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) can save the day, and the [Mophie Powerstation Pro AC Power Charger](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2000733&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fmophie-powerstation-pro-AC-2023-27-00-mAh-External-Battery-compatbile-MacBook-iPad-Portable-PD-battery-100W-60W-USB-C-Fast-Charge-integrated-carry-st%2F2702407586) is our top recommendation. It packs an impressive 27,000mAh battery and supports fast charging via its 60W USB-C PD port.

 The Mophie Powerstation Pro AC has a 100-watt AC port, a 60-watt USB-C PD port, a USB-C port, and a USB-A port so that you can simultaneously charge up to four devices, from laptops to smartphones. The large battery capacity makes for a heavy accessory, but you should still be able to house it in a laptop bag or carry-on with no problems.

| Up to 8 additional ports for your laptop                  | Not the best HDMI resolution |
| Fast USB-A ports with data transfer speeds of up to 5Gbps |                              |
| USB-C PD port with 85W pass-through charging              |                              |

 One consequence of laptops getting slimmer and lighter is the lack of ports to connect external accessories and peripherals. Most current-gen laptops come with just USB-C ports for charging and connectivity, so you'll need a good [USB-C hub](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-joint-venture-campaigns-for-brands-on-video-platforms/) to compensate for missing ports. There are plenty of excellent [USB-C hubs](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-joint-venture-campaigns-for-brands-on-video-platforms/) out there, offering a varied selection of ports. Our top pick, though, is the [EZQuest USB-C hub](https://www.amazon.com/EZQuest-Multimedia-Adapter-Gigabit-Ethernet/dp/B07PBF97M1/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000733&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-laptop-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 This robust 8-in-1 USB-C hub comes with three USB-A ports, each with data transfer speeds of up to 5Gbps and 10W power output, and a USB-C PD port with 85W pass-through charging. It also supports a 4K resolution at 30Hz, microSD and [SD card](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-what-lurks-behind-the-curtain-of-missing-video-suggestions/) slots, and a Gigabit Ethernet port.

 The EZ Quest USB-C hub is compatible with all laptops with USB-C ports, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and USB-C smartphones and tablets with OTG support.

 If you don’t need an Ethernet port, you can save some money and opt for the [Anker 7-in-1 USB-C Hub](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Upgraded-Delivery-Pixelbook-A83460A2/dp/B07ZVKTP53/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000733&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-laptop-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) instead.

 While laptops are meant to be highly portable devices you can use anywhere, it's not the most comfortable experience if you have one on your lap all the time. [Lap desks](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-find-my-iphone-without-apple-id-from-your-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/) are the ideal accessory if you don't have access to a desk when out and about, and one of the best you can get is the [LapGear Designer Lap Desk](https://www.amazon.com/LapGear-Designer-Desk-phone-holder/dp/B07N9L5FJJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000733&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-laptop-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 It comes with a soft padded cushion that acts as a buffer between your laptop and your thighs and is roomy enough to hold a 15.6-inch laptop and more. A device ledge holds your laptop in place and stops it from sliding off, while a built-in phone slot keeps your phone within easy reach. There's even an elastic band at the corner to hold your notes and other papers in place.

 Available in eight fun colors, the soft microbead cushion of the LapGear Designer Lap Desk is super comfortable and assumes the shape of your lap. Weighing just 2 pounds, it is lightweight and portable enough to be carried around the house or taken on a trip to the office or on a vacation, thanks to a handy carry handle.

## FAQ

### How do I clean my laptop?

 First, shut down your laptop and unplug it from the wall. Next, clean the ports, keys, vents, and other openings using compressed air. You can also wipe it down with a microfiber cloth. There are plenty of laptop-friendly cleaning sprays you can buy to keep your screen and keyboard in perfect condition. Some laptop manufacturers even include specific instructions for cleaning their devices.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Should I get a Windows laptop or a MacBook?

 Whether you get a Windows laptop or a MacBook depends on your specific needs, preferences, and budget. If you want an affordable laptop, a wide selection of software/apps, and more user control, then go for a Windows laptop. On the other hand, if you have a bigger budget, want more security, or own other Apple devices, a MacBook might be your best bet.

### Do I need a mouse with my laptop?

 All laptops come with a built-in touchpad or trackpad that functions as a mouse pointer. However, they're often less efficient than a traditional mouse. Most people prefer to buy a dedicated mouse to boost productivity and improve ergonomics. There are also wired and wireless options to consider, depending on your usage and budget.

### How do I know what size my laptop is?

 There are several ways to tell laptop size. Using a ruler, measure the diagonal from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, then convert your measurement to inches. You can also check your laptop's screen size online, if you know the model number, or look through the user manual. You can also get this information from your laptop's Display or Screen settings.
