### Key Takeaways

* Tenkeyless keyboards remove number pads, cutting costs & freeing up desk space.
* Tenkeyless keyboards reduce shoulder strain for better ergonomics.
* Smaller keyboards have cleaner aesthetics.

 Number pads are one of those things in life that you either use for hours every day or forget they exist. I belong to the latter camp. I like to get rid of things I don't use, and my next victim is the number pad.

##  I Never Use the Number Pad

 I'm a leftie, but thanks to years of experience using a computer mouse with my right hand, I got comfortable using the right-handed configuration. The same can't be said for number pads. I haven't typed that many numbers at any point in my life, and I doubt that'll change in the near future. If I ever do need one, I'll just buy a [standalone numpad](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-i-catch-the-regional-pokemon-without-traveling-on-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), preferably one with a backspace button.

 To me, the [number pad is dead weight](https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-create-cartoons-like-a-pro-top-10-tools-for-beginners/) that doesn't contribute to anything. I even made a mental note to use it whenever I needed to type numbers, but I still forgot it existed. I'm already used to the number row and don't feel it slowing me down. That's why I decided to buy a "tenkeyless" mechanical keyboard when I came across a good deal.

 In case you're not acquainted with the term, a [tenkeyless keyboard](https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/logitech-g502-gaming-mouse-troubleshooting-and-updating-drivers-made-simple/) has a standard layout but without the number pad. It's a familiar design that makes no compromises—assuming you don't need the number pad.

##  Much Better Comfort, With None of the Pain

 The primary reason gamers like smaller keyboards is that they're far more comfortable. The number pad doesn't get in my way that much when I work because I don't need to do quick movements with my mouse, such as flick shots, but when I play games, I have to move my keyboard all the way to the left and tilt it slightly. This position forces me to overextend my left arm, and the constant stretched position has weakened my rotator cuff, causing horrible shoulder pain.

 Our Editor-in-Chief, Jason, had the same problem but on the opposite side, with his right shoulder. He cured the pain by [switching to a tenkeyless keyboard](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-comprehensive-guide-to-icloud-unlock-on-apple-iphone-13-online-by-drfone-ios/) because it allowed him to use his mouse in a more natural position. If you've noticed that your shoulders feel tired after sitting at your desk, you should probably get a tenkeyless keyboard.

##  More Space for My Mouse

Ismar Hrnjicevic / How-To Geek

 I position my [Corsair K70](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Switches/dp/B09NCLR4M6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003135&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Freasons-im-buying-tenkeyless%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) in the middle of my desk when I type, which means I have very little mouse space left, and I constantly hit my right thumb against the sharp aluminum edge. As I mentioned above, moving the keyboard to the left fixes the space issue, but it also causes discomfort. So, switching to a tenkeyless would allow me to get the best of both worlds.

 You'd think that a number pad doesn't take up that much space, but I'd get a whole 3.1 inches (8 cm) if I got rid of the numpad. After some napkin math, I found that it'd increase my mouse space by 25%. That's a lot of free real estate.

Eric Schoon / How-To Geek

 Although a tenkeyless keyboard doesn't necessarily indicate a lower price point, they tend to be cheaper than their larger counterparts. For instance, the TKL version of the [Logitech G815](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P1DHN65/ref=twister%5FB0D2Y122JF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003135&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Freasons-im-buying-tenkeyless%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) costs less than the full-size model at MSRP. This is because they use less material, so they cost less to manufacture.

 If you opt for a [hot-swappable keyboard](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/streamlining-visual-storytelling-with-youtube-videos-for-2024/) (which you should), you'll save a lot of money on the switches and keycaps. You'll also save a few bucks on the PCB, plate, bottom case, and O-rings.

##  Minimalist Esthetics

 Although I'm not obsessed with minimalism, I find that smaller keyboards look "cleaner" than large, bulky models. There's more emphasis on the more important buttons, and there's less empty space, which makes it look more proportionate. Esthetics are the reason some people take it to the extreme by opting for tiny 60% keyboards that don't even have dedicated function keys. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the bolder, so you might disagree with this point.

##  Still More Functional Than Smaller Keyboards

 Unlike some smaller layouts, tenkeyless keyboards only get rid of the numpad. You still keep your arrow and navigation keys on the right and your function keys on the top. While I don't use those very often either, dedicated function keys are paramount. I don't want to have to hold the Fn button each time I want to refresh a page or close a window. Also, many models that are smaller than a tenkeyless tend to cram the keys too close to each other, which can make for an uncomfortable typing experience.
