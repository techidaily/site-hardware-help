## New Feature Alert: Discover the Intuitive Widget on Google Photos for Android

Google Assistant-powered Smart Displays can do a lot of powerful things, but people also just love the [simple photo frame feature](https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/can-chatgpts-humor-bring-a-giggle-exploring-the-power-of-ai-in-comedy/). If you use Google Photos on Android, you can get a similar effect on your home screen.

 The photo frame feature on Smart Displays is essentially a screen saver. You choose the Google Photos albums you want to see and it randomly rotates through all the photos. You can get the same feature on [Google TV/Android TV devices as well](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-10-top-tools-for-dynamic-image-background-alterations/).

 The Google Photos app for Android has a widget that acts similarly to the Smart Display photo frame feature. However, you can't choose the albums you want to see. The photos are pulled from the ["Your Memories" row](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ghostly-journey-droning-slick-action-recorder/) at the top of the app.

 To add the widget to your home screen, tap and hold your finger on a blank space on the home screen.

 Select "Widgets" from the menu. This may look slightly different depending on your device.

 Scroll through the list of widgets and look for the "Photos." The widget is called "Your Memories." Tap and hold the widget, then drag it around your home screen. Release your finger to drop it.

 After the widget is placed, most home screen launchers will allow you to resize it. Tap and hold the widget to bring up the resizing handles.

 That's all there is to it. The widget shows the title of the Memory it's pulling the photo from, such as "This Week 1 Year Ago," or the date the photo was taken. It's a great way to [see your Google Photos](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/mastering-wirecast-for-facebook-live-broadcasts-for-2024/) without committing to one as your wallpaper.
