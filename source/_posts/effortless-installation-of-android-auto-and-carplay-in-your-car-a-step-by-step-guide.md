## Effortless Installation of Android Auto and CarPlay in Your Car: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Key Takeaways

* Aftermarket head units with Android Auto and CarPlay can be complicated to install.
* Portable head units are cheap, easy to use, and don't require installation.
* Portable head units may even have bonus features that built-in systems don't have.

 Android Auto and Apple CarPlay have been around for a while, but not all of us drive vehicles with the technology built in. Of course, you could install an aftermarket head unit yourself, but that can be intimidating. There's actually a much easier way to do it—no wiring required.

##  Replacing a Head Unit Can Be Complicated

 There's no shortage of [aftermarket head units](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=head+unit+android+auto+carplay&crid=2O83FE2M7KSG8&sprefix=head+unit+android+auto+carplay%2Caps%2C84&ref=nb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%5F2&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003734&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fadding-android-auto-or-carplay-to-your-car-is-easier-than-you-think%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) with Android Auto and CarPlay for a wide variety of vehicles. Even my ancient 2009 Chevy Silverado allegedly has compatible models. However, there are a couple of things that have always held me back, and maybe you feel the same way.

 For starters, I'm an avid DIYer, but I am out of my depths when it comes to vehicles. I can read tutorials and watch videos all day, but ripping out a chunk of my vehicle's interior is still an intimidating prospect. I'm never comfortable working with electricity and wiring.

 The other problem is I could never be 100% positive that what I saw online was indeed compatible with my truck. My specific make and model were very difficult to find on compatibility lists, and I couldn't find examples of people with my exact vehicle in the reviews. This always left me feeling uncertain, so I lived with a [janky Spotify Car Thing](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-iphone-xr-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/) as an alternative.

 In the last year or so, "portable" head units with Android Auto and CarPlay have [exploded on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=portable+android+auto+carplay&crid=3JHHHRHWQBPCW&sprefix=portable+android+auto+carplay%2Caps%2C94&ref=nb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%5F1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003734&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fadding-android-auto-or-carplay-to-your-car-is-easier-than-you-think%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen). Back when I bought the Car Thing, I remember thinking a similar device with Android Auto would be awesome, and now they're readily available.

 "Portable," in this case, simply means the device is not a permanent, built-in part of your vehicle. They're essentially a modern-day version of a GPS that you might find on the dashboards of a car in the early 2000s. You get all the convenience of Android Auto or CarPlay in a compact package. The "installation" consists of finding the best way to mount it and plugging in the charging and aux cable.

 The [exact model I bought was only $45](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZV25TPC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003734&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fadding-android-auto-or-carplay-to-your-car-is-easier-than-you-think%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen)—which is much cheaper than any built-in model I found that _might_ work with my vehicle. It has a 7-inch touch screen and comes with a number of mounting options and cables. In just a couple of minutes, I had a fully functional Android Auto display in my 15-year-old rusty truck.

 The interesting thing about many of these portable Android Auto/CarPlay devices is they always seem to have more features than what you get in vehicles that come with the tech built-in.

 For example, my partner drives a 2019 Ford Escape with an infotainment system that has Android Auto and CarPlay built-in. However, it does not support wireless connections. You must connect your phone with a USB cable or [buy a wireless dongle](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-footage-to-film-the-ultimate-free-gopro-hd-video-editing-guide/). Meanwhile, my $45 device supports wireless connections out of the box.

 Another thing that my portable screen has is AirPlay and "Android Cast." Technically, I could cast videos to the screen for passengers to watch. I don't think I will ever actually use the feature, but it's not something you'd find built into many vehicles ([unless Google has something to say about it](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/best-movie-trailers/)).

 Portable head units are a great way to add Android Auto and CarPlay to any car, even older models. They're easy to install and often come with bonus features not found in built-in systems. If you're looking to upgrade your car's infotainment system without the hassle, a portable head unit is a great option. I'm glad I did.
