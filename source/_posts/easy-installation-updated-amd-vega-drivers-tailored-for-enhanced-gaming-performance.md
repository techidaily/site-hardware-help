 **Option 1 – Download and update my Killer network driver manually**

 Killer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Killer’s official  website, check out the right driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually. (Which could either be an inf file or a zip file).
