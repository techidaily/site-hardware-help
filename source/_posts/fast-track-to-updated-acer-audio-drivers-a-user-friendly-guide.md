## Easy Methods to Refresh and Update Your Audio Technica Drivers Today

Want to update the driver for your Audio Technica headsets, microphones, or turntables? We’ll walk you through every step to update the driver successfully.

## Do I need drivers for Audio Technica?

 Audio Technica offers a plug-and-play feature by allowing your operating system to recognize your product via a USB audio driver.

 This means that there’s no specific driver for your USB microphones or turntables, so it doesn’t need an additional driver installation. But if your device fails to be detected, or it’s not working properly, you can update the USB audio driver.
