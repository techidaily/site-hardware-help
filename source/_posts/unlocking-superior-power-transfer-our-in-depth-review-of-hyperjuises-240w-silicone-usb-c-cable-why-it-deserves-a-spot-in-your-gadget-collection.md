The [Hyper HyperJuice 240W Silicone USB-C to USB-C](http://www.amazon.com/HyperJuice-Silicone-Tangle-Free-Over-Temperature-Protection/dp/B0CT959MLB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003650&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fhyper-hyperjuice-240w-usb-c-cable-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) cable is designed to be tangle-free, handle high power requirements, and go the distance with longer length options available.

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 Up until the past few years, USB-C was only able to deliver up to 96W of power. Even then, it was really only Apple that pushed that much juice through a USB-C cable to a computer. However, with the [introduction of PD 3.1](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/) a few years ago, we started to see cables and chargers supporting up to 240W of Power Delivery, and that’s what this Hyper cable is rated for.

 While most gaming laptops have dedicated power bricks, many are starting to offer [PD 3.1 charging options at up to 140W](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-vivo-y78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). We haven't seen many hit the 240W peak yet. However, having this Hyper cable means you’ll be ready for whenever you upgrade. I’ve used it with my iPhone 15 Pro, 11-inch iPad Pro, and 14-inch M1 Max MacBook Pro all without issues. None of those devices draw 240W (or even 140W), the cable still worked perfectly with them.

 That’s the beauty of USB-C. You can buy a cable that handles far more than what you need right now, and it’ll work great with all devices. Since this cable is rated for up to 240W, it’ll step down to essentially whatever wattage your connected device needs.

##  Swapping Nylon Braids for Silicone Was a Unique Choice, but a Good One

![Close up of the Hyper HyperJuice 240W Silicone USB-C to USB-C Cable](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/close-up-of-the-hyper-hyperjuice-240w-silicone-usb-c-to-usb-c-cable_53655427487_o.jpg)

 Typically, we see more premium cables braided in nylon. It makes the cord more durable and also helps it to be fairly tangle-free. Well, Hyper decided to ditch the nylon braiding and go the route of a silicone sleeve, and it works. I wasn’t sure about it at first, and I’m still not entirely sure about the feel, but the function is there.

 I did my best to tangle the cord a few times, and, while it can still get in knots (when you figure out how to fix that, let me know), it was very easy to untangle in every scenario. I don’t see a situation where this cable would become so tangled that you wouldn’t be able to untie it, or even that it would get damaged. Hyper says that the cable is tested to withstand up to 25,000 bends.

##  Please Don’t Use This Cable for Data Transfers

![The Hyper HyperJuice 240W Silicone USB-C to USB-C Cable plugged in a phone](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/the-hyper-hyperjuice-240w-silicone-usb-c-to-usb-c-cable-plugged-in-a-phone_53655427472_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 Although it does fast power, this is essentially a charge-only cable. It’ll handle data transfers but the transmission rate is stuck in the stone age at 480Mbps thanks to being a USB 2.0 cable. This is fine for some things, like connecting your mouse to a computer, plugging up a printer, or hooking up to a laser engraver, but outside of that, you’re not going to want to use this cord for data transfers.

 To put the speed into perspective, modern USB-C standards can handle up to 40Gbps, which is 12 times the speed of what this cable can do. That means what you can move in 1 minute over a USB4 cable would (theoretically) take 12 minutes here. And, with the limitations of USB 2.0, would likely take much, much longer. So, stick to using this cable for charging or slow data transfers only, as that’s what it’s designed for.

##  Should You Buy the Hyper HyperJuice 240W USB-C Cable?

 The [Hyper HyperJuice 240W Silicone USB-C to USB-C](http://www.amazon.com/HyperJuice-Silicone-Tangle-Free-Over-Temperature-Protection/dp/B0CT959MLB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003650&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fhyper-hyperjuice-240w-usb-c-cable-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) cable is one of my favorites. I love the way that [Apple’s braided nylon USB-C cable](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m) feels, but the design of it allows for it to get dirty pretty quickly. Hyper's cable here will be easy to wipe off, doesn’t tangle quickly, and is ready to deliver up to 240W of power to connected devices. At just $25 for the 6-foot model, this cable is something that I think every USB-C device owner should have.
