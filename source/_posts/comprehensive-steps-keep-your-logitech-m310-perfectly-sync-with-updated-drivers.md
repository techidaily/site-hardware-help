## Logitech Keyboard Setup & Drivers Compatible with Windows 10 – Download Here

If you’d like to update drivers for your Logitech wireless keyboard, don’t worry. You can download and update the driver easily with one of the methods below.

1. [**Download and update the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Download and update the driver automaticall**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Method 1: Download and update the driver manually

 If you prefer to download drivers manually, you can download and update your Logitech wireless keyboard driver manually from Logitech official website:

 1) Go to[Logitech Download page](http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads)  .  
  
 2) Type your Logitech wireless keyboard model name in the search box and click the **More**  button for more content. (Let’s take K400 for example.)

## Method 2: Download and update the driver automatically

 To download driver from Logitech website, you need to identify the right driver from the software list. It could be waste of time. It is harder if you don’t know much about computer. So if you would like to download Logitech wireless keyboard drivers more easily, instead of downloading drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
