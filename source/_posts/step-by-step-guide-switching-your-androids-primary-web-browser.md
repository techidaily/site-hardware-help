### Key Takeaways

 The combination of a smartphone or tablet and a search engine makes it easy to find just about anything at a moment's notice. If you have an Android device, you may think that the search engine has to be Google, but it doesn't. Here's how to change the default search engine on Android.

 Google services are integrated very deeply into Android devices, but that doesn't mean that you have to use them. Google Search is no exception to this. You can easily change the default search engine to a third-party provider, just like you can for many other parts of the Android experience.

##  Change the Default Search Engine in Chrome

 To change the search engine on Android, you'll need to go to the places where you do your searches. For most people, it's the web browser. Google Chrome is the web browser that comes on all Android devices, so we'll start there.

 Open Google Chrome on your [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU210690/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) device. Tap the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner. and select "Settings" from the menu.

 Tap "Search Engine."

 Choose one of the search engines from the list.

 Chrome is just one web browser you can use on an Android device. Practically every browser will have the ability to choose a default search engine. Be sure to explore the settings in whichever browser you use.

##  Swap out the Google Home Screen Widget

 Another common way that people access a search engine on their Android device is through a home screen widget. The Google Search widget is included by default on many phones and tablets.

 In most cases, you can simply remove the Google Search widget and replace it with one from the app of your preferred search engine. You will not be able to do this if you use the default Google Pixel launcher, however.

 First, we'll remove the Google Search widget. Start by long-pressing on the bar and selecting "Remove" from the widget.

![Removing a widget from home screen.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot_20240110-160441.png) 

 That's it for removing. Now, we can add a different search widget to the home screen. Long-press on a blank space on the home screen an you'll see some sort of menu with "Widgets" as an option.

 Scroll through the list of widgets and find the one from the search app you have installedâ€”Bing, in this case. Tap and hold the widget.

 Now you have quick access to the search engine from your home screen!

##  Change the Default Smart Assistant

 The last thing we can do is change the default Digital Assistant app. On many Android smartphones and tablets, this is set to Google Assistant by default. Many third-party search apps can be set as the default Digital Assistant, which means that you can quickly launch them with these same gestures.

 To do this, go to Settings > Apps > Default Apps.

![Default Apps in Android settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot_20240110-160715.png) 

 The section we want to use is "Digital Assistant App." Tap the item.

![Digital Assistant app in Android settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot_20240110-160732.png) 

 Select "Default Digital Assistant App" at the top.

![Default Digital Assistant app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot_20240110-160741.png) 

 Choose the search engine that you want to use.

 That's it! Now, when you use the assistant gestures, you'll go straight to a search with your preferred search engine. Hopefully, with all of these methods, you can use your favorite search engines with ease.
