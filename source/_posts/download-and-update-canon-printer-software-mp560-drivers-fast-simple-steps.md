## Free Canon Printer Driver Downloads and Latest Updates - Get Started Now

The Canon MP250 driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with the printer you use. If the driver isn’t properly installed on your computer, or it gets corrupted somehow, you’re likely to run into issues such as blank page printing, error code messages, etc.

 So, when something goes wrong with your printer, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. There are two ways to get the Canon MP250 driver easily:

* **[Option 1 – Manually install the driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Option 2 – Automatically install the driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/canon-mp250-driver-download-for-windows-10-8-7/#b)**

**2)**  Enter your printer serial number**mp250** and search for it.

**3)** Find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**4)**  Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.
