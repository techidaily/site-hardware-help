## To update your AMD Radeon RX 590 graphics card driver

There are two ways you can do this:

**Download and install your RX 590 driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the **[AMD website](https://www.amd.com/)**  , and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your graphics card, and your version of Windows.

or

**Download and install your RX 590 driver automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your RX 590 driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
