## Samsung's Latest Contender: The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro Vs. Apple's AirPods Pro

Samsung revealed a bunch of new devices today at its Unpacked event, including the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. The Pro model has an updated design that is reminiscent of Apple AirPods Pro, but with some unique tricks.

 Samsung has just announced the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, a more premium alternative to the [Galaxy Buds 3](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-silent-microphones-a-step-by-step-guide-to-restoring-voice-chat-in-discord/) that were also revealed. The earbuds boast a suite of intelligent features, a lot of which are AI-powered, that are designed to enhance communication and optimize sound quality. There are updated 2-way speakers with a planar tweeter for precise high-range sound, as well as Dual Amplifiers for crystal-clear audio, and Ultra High Quality Audio for high-resolution listening.

 Most of the features available on the Buds Pro are also available on the Buds 3\. One particular standout is the Interpreter mode, which translates foreign language lectures in real time directly through the earbuds, but only when paired with a [Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-vsf-video-capture-insights-a-critical-look-for-2024/), [Galaxy Z Flip 6](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/no-cash-all-fun-turning-twitter-vids-into-gifs-for-2024/), or other "Samsung Galaxy smartphone" with the latest available software updates. Voice Command functionality allows for hands-free control of music playback with simple voice prompts.

 There's also Adaptive Noise Control, Siren Detect, and Voice Detect to intelligently adjust noise levels and optimize audio quality in real-time. Whether you're listening to music or taking a call, the earbuds adapt to your surroundings to deliver the best possible sound. Additionally, the earbuds feature machine learning-based voice restoration technology to enhance call quality in noisy environments with the Super-Wideband Call feature.

 The addition of AI-powered features, in continuation of Samsung's recent policy of slapping AI on pretty much all of its high-priced products, certainly makes them unique, although you will need a Samsung phone in order to take advantage of most of these features. The Buds 3 Pro cost $249.99, which puts them solidly up with other premium offerings from the likes of Sony. They are [available for pre-order now](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile-audio%2Fgalaxy-buds3-pro%2F), and they should reach your doorstep by July 24th.
